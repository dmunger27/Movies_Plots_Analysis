Having to spend his youth in Lipiny of all places, a soot-blackened industrial area reputed to be PolandÃâs poorest city with the highest pollution, doesnÃât make things easier. Moreover, Daniel lives with his grandmother, a dominant, chain-smoking termagant who frequently gives him an earful though she really means well. So itÃâs only natural to try something crazy, original Ãâ make a film for example? He roams the streets of his neighbourhood with his mobile phone camera, asking kids, schoolmates and homeless people about their dreams. When they unexpectedly come true, Daniel is behind it. Everything is possible in film. Only his grandmother almost jeopardises his project, even though despite her crabbiness she is the secret star of this backhanded work. In a cheerful mix of documentary observation and staged scenes, filmmaker Pawe&amp;#322; Wysocza&amp;#324;ski raises the question of truth and truthfulness. A plea for dreams, however unrealistic they may be. In the end itÃâs not important whether Daniel will ever finish his film. After all, he has a grandmother no screenwriter could have invented.

sing tacky Euro-disco songs about spotted pants &amp; the like. Their fans
smile, dance, get drunk, &amp; fight . . . &amp; buy their records: 16 million
of them. Bayer Full become the most successful Polish artists ever.

2010 Shanghai. Krzysztof Darewicz, maverick Polish expat, phones
Slawek Swierzynski, farmer &amp; leader of the long-forgotten band, with a
Ãâlittle planÃâ:

ÃâYou will reform &amp; play concerts in China. And, you will sing &amp; record
a new album - in Chinese. SimpleÃâ.

But, in formal talks with the Chinese, Swierzynski makes one cultural
gaffe after another - a Chinese ÃâLost in TranslationÃâ this most
certainly is. But, unlike Bill Murray, Swierzynski is laughing.
Darewicz is not.

As the band struggle with the Chinese lyrics, SwierzynskiÃâs fearsome
ego awakens &amp; he begins to act of his own volition.

Ãâ(Swierzynski) seems to forget that this was not &amp; will not be
possible without meÃâ.

As reports of a Ãâ67 million CD recording contractÃâ filter through to
the feverish media, Darewicz continues bitterly:

ÃâItÃâs possible your film will be about how Bayer Full didnÃât go to
China &amp; fooled the entire Polish nationÃâ.

One Billion Happy People,2011,N/A,18 May 2012,65 min,Documentary,Maciej Bochniak,Maciej Bochniak,"Krzysztof Darewicz, Slawomir Swierzynski, Biao Chen","1990Ãâs Rural Post-Communist Poland. Four villagers with Casio-tones
sing tacky Euro-disco songs about spotted pants &amp; the like. Their fans
smile, dance, get drunk, &amp; fight . . . &amp; buy their records: 16 million
of them. Bayer Full become the most successful Polish artists ever.

2010 Shanghai. Krzysztof Darewicz, maverick Polish expat, phones
Slawek Swierzynski, farmer &amp; leader of the long-forgotten band, with a
Ãâlittle planÃâ:

ÃâYou will reform &amp; play concerts in China. And, you will sing &amp; record
a new album - in Chinese. SimpleÃâ.

But, in formal talks with the Chinese, Swierzynski makes one cultural
gaffe after another - a Chinese ÃâLost in TranslationÃâ this most
certainly is. But, unlike Bill Murray, Swierzynski is laughing.
Darewicz is not.

As the band struggle with the Chinese lyrics, SwierzynskiÃâs fearsome
ego awakens &amp; he begins to act of his own volition.

Ãâ(Swierzynski) seems to forget that this was not &amp; will not be
possible without meÃâ.

As reports of a Ãâ67 million CD recording contractÃâ filter through to
the feverish media, Darewicz continues bitterly:

ÃâItÃâs possible your film will be about how Bayer Full didnÃât go to
China &amp; fooled the entire Polish nationÃâ.
