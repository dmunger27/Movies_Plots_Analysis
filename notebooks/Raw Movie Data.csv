ThereÂ’s trouble with the teachers, his boxing coach wants to see more motivation. And when it rains, it pours. Having to spend his youth in Lipiny of all places, a soot-blackened industrial area reputed to be PolandÂ’s poorest city with the highest pollution, doesnÂ’t make things easier. Moreover, Daniel lives with his grandmother, a dominant, chain-smoking termagant who frequently gives him an earful though she really means well. So itÂ’s only natural to try something crazy, original Â– make a film for example? He roams the streets of his neighbourhood with his mobile phone camera, asking kids, schoolmates and homeless people about their dreams. When they unexpectedly come true, Daniel is behind it. Everything is possible in film. Only his grandmother almost jeopardises his project, even though despite her crabbiness she is the secret star of this backhanded work. In a cheerful mix of documentary observation and staged scenes, filmmaker Pawe&amp;#322; Wysocza&amp;#324;ski raises the question of truth and truthfulness. A plea for dreams, however unrealistic they may be. In the end itÂ’s not important whether Daniel will ever finish his film. After all, he has a grandmother no screenwriter could have invented.
