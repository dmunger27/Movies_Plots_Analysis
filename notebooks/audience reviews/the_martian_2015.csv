4.0,"While it may be top-heavy on science and technology, these elements never bog down the film.  Ridley Scott's The Martian, first and foremost, is about human resilience, the ability to overcome impossible odds and survive in an inhospitable environment.  When astronaut and botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris during a storm and swept away, he is assumed dead by the rest of the crew and is left behind when they are forced to make an emergency evacuation.  Damon is great in the demanding lead role, balancing his desperation to survive with dark humor.  Dariusz Wolski's cinematography effectively captures the vast, desolate expanses of the landscape.  Despite the fact that the majority of the scenes only feature one character, Scott is able to keep things moving along at a steady pace, making The Martian a compelling experience.",Dave S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Apr 05, 2022",Dave S,/user/id/978826756,RT,978826756,,The Martian

3.5,"The Martian is a rather interesting thought experiment about survival on Mars and tells the story of an astronaut stranded on the planet after an accident. The movie's excitement originates mostly from its display of problem solving rather than from its characters and events and it is a healthy reminder that in order to survive humanity can draw on a diverse skill-set such as humor, pragmatism and imagination.

From start to finish, this film keeps you gripped to the story, with incredibly groundbreaking, humor that surprisingly lands, and almost realistic CGI and a fantastic soundtrack to be the cherry on top of it all. The A-list cast does very well too, with familiar faces constantly appearing even after you thought that they'd included enough. The ending is a bit predictable, however, and the story at the end is pretty generic. However, this is quickly overshadowed by all the great things about this film.

3.5,"Premiering at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, Ridley Scotts's 'The Martian' tells the incredible story of one man's survival after being left on Mars. Spanning over 141 minutes, 'The Martian' brings Andy Weir's 2011 novel to the big screen in a well-paced, well-written affair that features a star-studded cast with Matt Damon at its helm.

Presumed dead by his team after a vicious storm during a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself stranded on the red planet, 385 million kilometres away from home. Relying on his resourcefulness, Mark must find a way to keep himself alive and find a way to signal to Earth that he didn't die while NASA and his crew try to reach him.

Matt Damon gives a great performance in the lead role. He does a terrific job keeping viewers interested throughout the film, especially considering he's the only person in the majority of the scenes. The supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, and a whole host of Hollywood's finest, all give solid performances across the film. Not only does Damon do a splendid job keeping viewers entertained, but Drew Goddard's screenplay makes sure viewers don't get bored when Watney starts mentioning things like hexadecimals and many other scientific details. 

For the most part, the science behind 'The Martian' is surprisingly accurate. Some are cosmetic, but the most important one, the storm that causes the film's events to take place, is something that can't physically happen. Scott's use of various wide and overhead shots does a great job emphasising Mark's isolation and loneliness. The visual effects on display throughout the film are impressive.  The VFX department does an incredible job making sure the CGI used looks realistic and doesn't blatantly stand out to viewers.

Despite being a futuristic sci-fi film, 'The Martian' incorporates themes that link to ideas of human nature and humanity's future. Man's natural desire to persevere and survive plays a key role in the film - If Mark didn't have this overwhelming hunger to survive he probably wouldn't have made it home; this directly links to themes of hope and possibility. One of the first times Mark addresses the audience, he directly says 'I'm Not Gonna Die Here'. The film asks the question of what future space travel will look like, and if we might actually have humans on mars sooner rather than later.

The biggest theme, however, is isolation/separation and what effects prolonged isolation has on someone. The only thing that appears to keep Mark sane through the film seems to be his access to a video log, telling both the log and viewers, what he's thinking and planning. The psychological effect of this shows up when Mark is finally rescued by his team and instantly tears up at the thought of being with other people again. Even the production design carries across this theme; the crew's kit and equipment remind Mark that he's all alone, with nothing and no one. 

On the whole, 'The Martian' does a brilliant job making the viewers feel like they're with Mark. The production design, camera movements and performances all help the viewer feel as though they're in the scene with Mark.

Overall, 'The Martian' is a superb film that showcases a sensational performance from its lead and features striking cinematography. Ridley Scott provides audiences with a movie that fans of off-planet adventures will enjoy for years to come.",Molly M,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Aug 06, 2021",Molly M,/user/id/978827358,RT,978827358,,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian
An enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story.

Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny, ""The Martian ""offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott. What's so fascinating about the film is that it truly turns on the solving of problems!
   
The story goes by when astronauts blast off from the planet Mars, they leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed dead after a fierce storm. With only a meagre amount of supplies, the stranded visitor must utilise his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on the hostile planet. Meanwhile, back on Earth, members of NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home, while his crew mates hatch their own plan for a daring rescue mission.

The storytelling techniques work well enough to keep the film engaging. Its a film about human error, the will to survive, and the responsibility that we have as human beings, not just to the work that we dedicate our lives to, but to one another as people. Despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a ""space movie"". 

The acting and plot are great featuring the best work and the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, and an outstanding supporting cast.

The Martian is an extraordinary tale of Watney's extreme optimism, courage, determination and most importantly, ingenuity. It's more than anything, a love letter to science.",Shambhavi S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jul 27, 2021",Shambhavi S,/user/id/979214250,RT,979214250,,The Martian

4.5,"The Martian is a genuinely fun movie, and if asked, I'd give it nine out of ten stars. The characters, primarily Matt Damon's Mark Watney, are charming and fun to watch, which honestly makes the whole movie work.

The beginning is strong. Everything on Mars is hectic, until it isn't and Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. The narrative takes time with Watney, the near silence from Watney and tense synth-y score really pulling the audience into Watney's head, almost uncomfortably close. Very intimate. It sets up… not stakes, exactly, but the seriousness of the movie. Later, Watney will joke around accompanied by cheesy 70's music, but in the beginning, the movie grounds itself, letting the more serious moments later also finding their place alongside the sillier ones.

Matt Damon really nails Mark Watney, making him likable with depth in a way that makes me forgive how little character development takes place. With all the talent, gravitas, and charm the other actors bring, the acting is one of the strongest parts of the movie. You can't help but root for Watney to get saved, for his crew to come rescue him, for everything to go right back on Earth. The narrative does them all favors too, because even though you're sure he'll be saved and everything will be alright, all that goes wrong keeps making you wonder, ""What if?"" Even if that's not a question in your mind, it's immensely entertaining to see Watney get from Point A to Point B. The script is clever in this respect, and while I don't know if the science was correct, the movie impresses upon its audience complicated science without making it feel too easy or too difficult to understand. 

The lighthearted moments are definitely one of the biggest draws of the movie. Just as this movie is rooted in serious stakes and dangerous situations, it has little jokes or bright music to uplift it. The movie treads a careful balance without the humor seeming forced or the tenseness dragging everything down. It succeeds, for sure. The suspense feels more real when broken up by those little fun moments, and the little fun moments make the movie all the more watchable.

5.0,"Ridley Scott this time has adapted Andy Weir's best-selling novel of the same name. Which detailed a stranded astronaut's story to survive on Mars with the resources he has and botany skills to boot. Scripted by Drew Goddard of The Cabin in the Woods fame and starring Matt Damon in the central role of Mark Watney. All of this has come together to form one of Ridley Scott's best films for some time. Certainly at this point in time, his best film since American Gangster.

The story goes that a space crew is stationed on Mars, there to explore the Acidalia Planitia plain as part of their expedition. A storm rages which prompts them to leave, but not before Mark Watney played by Matt Damon is struck by a piece of a satellite antenna and is presumed dead by the crew. NASA gets wind of this and has a memorial service in his name, believing him to be dead. Sure enough, Watney survives but is in the risk of losing air.

Having managed to make it to to the base, he comes to the realisation that he is alone, with little food and contact with no-one. Therefore using a space log to update his activities, he plans to use his special botany skills and ingenuity to survive. To make contact in the hope that he can somehow escape and reunite with his crew and Earth itself. The film works on several levels. The cast themselves are part of an ensemble and all shine together in this film. From Matt Damon as our lead, a worn-down but cocky and confident individual, who you all root for to make it back home in the long run. To Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander Melissa Lewis, the authoritative and leading figure to her crew and all-out disco music fan. To Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA's director of space missions who carries the burden on earth to bring Watney back safely. To Jeff Daniels director of NASA who is cautious and decisive to a fault, just to name a few.

 The film manages to be surprisingly funny even during the more sombre and dark moments. By no means is this film a comedy (as the Golden Globes believed it was…) nor is it out of place or sporadic. Which is a credit to Drew Goddard's script who possesses a successful track record of subtly blending drama and comedy together to significant effect. I think it is also a credit to Ridley Scott, who doesn't downplay or fight against the right tone for the film, but more flows with it. Sometimes a script and Scott's vision in the past would conflict disastrously – but here it's lighting in a bottle. The steps Watney takes to survive, whether growing potatoes in a confined space of dirt and faeces by using leftover rocket fuel to produce hydrogen or dismantling equipment and ship parts to make movement viable by the direction of NASA scientists; is fascinating to watch.

Not just because the audience know what's at stake, but the level of humourous insight renders any steps into dreariness; making it an excellent but reflective thrill ride of a film. Just watching the movie blending all those successful elements together marks it as a triumphant rendition of the novel itself and offers surprises along the way. This is undoubtedly a film that isn't there to make a grand, ultimate statement. Nor is it trying to be a deep, experience film like in the vein of 2001: a Space Odyssey or Interstellar but is just only an entertaining, enjoyable survival story. That has its moments of reflection and more than enough time for the audience to spend time with Watney on his journey to survive and also be in the company of a great cast to boot. To the power of the botanist and film director, this is definitely one of his best outings and reaffirms Ridley Scott as one of cinema's greatest storytellers.",Jack M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Feb 02, 2021",Jack M,/user/id/967658420,RT,967658420,,The Martian

4.0,"The Martian is a movie that details the struggles of one man, Mark Watney, as he attempts to survive in the barren wasteland of the martian planet. As Mark Watney struggles to survive, his team copes with the guilt of having left behind Mark under the assumption that he had died due to a sand storm.

Throughout the movie, The Martian holds the audience in suspense as the audience watches Mark struggle to grow food, reclaim water, maintain the habitat structure, and contact earth. The Martian also skillfully depicts the crew's struggles with guilt, and accurately shows their feasible  mission to save him.

Despite the fact that The Martian is a science fiction thriller, the movie accurately depicts the struggles to survive on a barren planet, as well as the technology that martian astronauts would likely have. This degree of realism when depicting Mark Watney's world helps effectively create a sense of tension as Mark struggles to grow food, a sense of the total desolation when viewing the martian planet, and a sense of vastness to accurately show truely how stranded Mark is.

4.0,"The Martian é um dos melhores entretenimentos do gênero.

Tem um elenco maravilhoso, com o Matt Damon entregando uma ótima performance. Um roteiro muito bem escrito, com propostas inteligentes e que convencem, sem parecer muito forçado ou até mesmo viajado, o que é um ponto muito positivo pois acompanhar alguém inteligente é muito satisfatório. É claro que o filme abusa um pouco de arquétipos, principalmente no personagem do Donald Glover, que eu acredito estar lá só por conta da visibilidade, mas qualquer forma, o ritmo é fenomenal, propondo diversas cenas cômicas, de descobrimento e até mesmo tensas, o que me fez deixar de ser um pouco chato dessa vez.

A atmosfera de marte é muito boa. Poderia ser mais imersiva, quanto ao calor e vazio, mas talvez fugisse um pouco da proposta, que é nos divertir, e nisso ele funciona muito bem - eu, pelo menos, dei muita risada. Enfim, a fotografia se aproveita bastante do tom quente no deserto e com uma paleta de cores mais clean na ""base"" ou na nave, o que dá um ótimo contraste entre condições. Alguns planos abertos são verdadeiras pinturas e o HDR acrescenta muito nessa obra. A OST está presente em diversos momentos e dá o peso que o momento precisa. A soundtrack, de acordo com meu gosto musical, não poderia ser melhor, com musicas clássicas que simplesmente nos animam só de escutá-las.

The Martian é divertido, inteligente, conta com um ótimo elenco, e mesmo forçando a barra em um estereotipo ou outro, funciona muito bem como um todo.

4.0,"(SPOILER ALERT!!)

Summary: 
The movie follows Astronaut Mark Watney's journey of surviving from a catastrophic event of being stranded on Mars. Everything started from an emergency mission abort due to a deadly Martian dust storm. During the abortion, Watney gets hit by a runaway debris antenna and his signal is lost. The other crewmates left him on Mars, thinking that the debris had killed him.
 Miraculously, Watney survived. However, he is left alone with no communication and only some resources. Watney, being the botany specialist of the crew, utilizes his skills to grow potatoes on Mars to survive until the next Mars mission. Meanwhile, NASA discovers that Watney is still alive. Through hard work, NASA and Watney restore communication with each other using the decommissioned Pathfinder probe. NASA also comes up with a plan to send resources to Watney. Just as things are turning to the bright side, however, Watney's farm and habitat module explode. Watney will starve. Therefore, NASA is on a tight schedule to send food to Watney and skips some safety tests. As a result, the only payload rocket that NASA can get it to Mars in time crashes. Fortunately, the Chinese space agency offers their only rocket available to save Watney. NASA goes through internal conflicts on how to use their last chance. They decide to go for the plan with a higher chance of succeeding but risks Watney and his five crewmembers' lives. The crew, without hesitation, goes back to Mars to save Watney. They go through the remaining obstacles. Watney gets saved.

Analysis: 
The first thing we see is Mars. A manned space program is taking place. Mars is a hostile environment. By showing that us humans made it to Mars, it implies the possibilities of mankind. The movie tries to express the struggle of mankind in front of nature. Then it escalates to deliver a message that the possibilities of mankind are way larger than we think.
The process of surviving on Mars involves many aspects of mankind. It involves knowledge. With Watney's knowledge of Chemistry, he was able to create water out of rocket fuel. With his knowledge of history, he was able to recall the decommissioned Pathfinder probe to use it to restore communication with Earth. With his botany skills, he saved himself from starving. 
Surviving on Mars involves discipline as well. Watney could not have returned alive without working hard. We can see his constant struggle to resist the hostile environment of Mars. To quote Mark Watney himself from the original novel the movie is based on, he said, ""Mars keeps trying to kill me."" He is aware that Mars was very hostile and keeps himself striving to stay alive.
The most important thing is that it involves hope. If Watney had drowned in despair, he would have died even before any hostility of the Martian environment could reach him. If there was no hope, Watney's crewmates would have hesitated to go back to Mars to save him. It was hope that motivated Watney to travel a long distance to his window of escape.

Critique/Recommendation: 
Towards the climax, Watney makes a hole in his spacesuit to maneuver himself to the crew. While this is a compelling scene, it does not make much sense. It does serve as a good plot device. However, some fans would have figured that the laws of physics will frown on this scene. A hole in the suit means catastrophe. While it is well sugarcoated in the movie, it is impossible to control the force of the explosive depressurization with your bare arm. Also, the oxygen in your body would be drained rapidly, and your blood will literally boil and freeze at the same time due to a drastic difference in terms of pressure. I admit that the movie was able to give a strong climax by sacrificing this accuracy, but I think that scientific accuracy is also a major factor to consider when making a hard-sci-fi movie like this.
Informative stuff aside, I would like to compliment the film directors on how the urgency was depicted in the intro scene. In the start of the movie, a fatal Martian dust storm forces the crew to abort their mission. All crewmates evacuate to perform an emergency launch. However, Watney is hit by debris on his way to the evacuation vehicle. Every factor of this scene gives a boost to maximize the anxiousness of whether who will survive and who will die. The low visibility, the tone of the actors, and even the sound effect of a deadly Martian dust storm. Especially when the evacuation vehicle was about to tip and crash, it gave me the chills.
While the movie tells us about a man's desperate struggle to survive, it sprinkles some humor to prevent exhaustion. For example, when Watney literally digs up a nuclear battery of plutonium to solve his heating problem, he goes like, ""Ha, I don't care. Look, the point is that I am not cold anymore."" The background music, ""Hot Stuff"" by Donna Summer also gives a laugh, since plutonium, a radioactive isotope that unleashes heat, is literally the ""hot stuff"".
My personal opinion is that the movie is unique because there has not been a decent Mars movie for quite a long time. I like the movie especially because it resembles the Apollo 13 incident, where all humanity becomes one in praying for the safe return of a soul endangered in space. I would also personally recommend reading the original novel as well because it doubles the joy. considering all these factors, I think that this is a well-made movie and therefore my final rating is 4.0 stars.",Taewoo K,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Sep 25, 2020",Taewoo K,/user/id/978862583,RT,978862583,,The Martian

5.0,"As a science and movie geek, this was a gold mine.

The movie starts with a bang, doesn't waste that many minutes and goes to full thriller mode.
Even the 'medical' scene of him taking out the rod was well acted and intense.
Got so many goosebumps when Matt's first discovery was found by NASA.

The concept of Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is great. Props to the original writer and adapters to faithfully keeping most of it.

Cinematography was great, made boring desert Mars look stunning, praises for the direction by Ridley Scott has nothing to add more for his rich career.

I thought it was only ganna be Matt Damon but boy was I wrong. Movie nerd inside me brust open when I saw that humangase of a cast.

Jessica Chestain,Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan(Bucky) and Micheal Pena(Luizzz) in the main crew. The relationship set up between the crew was well executed without that much scenes, build up, at the start.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is fantastic, his protrayal of helpful and caring person was phenomenally done. Jeff Daniels as NASA Director stole some scenes for me at the start with his rude caricature. Wong and Donald Glover had short but very effective scene time. Sean Bean not dying has no scientific explanation.

All the NASA scenes, Mars scenes, JPL, China & Hermes working together felt great. Everybody uniting to save a human life was realistic.(real life situation of Thailand kids).

The movie had great sprinkles of comedy. Protagonist humourous approach to every trouble and optimistic characterisation served the themes of 'not giving up' pretty well. Looking for best in the worst of things. Hence he came back alive, cuz he science the sh!t of it.

Now the sciennccce,
'The greatest botanist in this planet', 'Botany isn't science.' Using radioactive decay to solve cooling problem, using own poop as fertilizers was fantastic, making H2O from N2H2 and blowing himself up for miscalculation got the science right. Even astronomical science, rocket science had some realism in them. Blowing up Hermes and poking space suit for thrust as Iron Man, superb. Mars is the name of Roman God of War, and his Greek version is called 'Ares', hence the name Ares3 4 for Mars mission.

4.5,"I am a sucker for sci-fi big spectacle and CGI fest films, even if many of them are predictable, unoriginal, and boring. However, The Martian brings both and intriguing space travel mission mixed with a commentary on modern society in terms of morality and survival. This is balanced out by a beautifully done script that manages to be both suspenseful and comedic, the performances by the whole cast, and obviously the amazing visual effects and cinematography. 

The only complaint I have is that it is too long, and at times it becomes repetitive and therefore somewhat boring. However, it is only for a short amount of time and it does not become prevalent in the whole film.

I watched an astronaut review of this movie and he only pointed out one flaw in the actual science of the movie.

But here are two things I realized: 1. The conflict in this film is obviously Man vs. Nature (Whitney vs. Mars). The conflict in every movie doesn't have to be Man vs. Man. 2. It was actually very refreshing to watch a movie where everyone is with each other and doesn't hate each other's guts. What I mean by that is it was nice to see that somebody didn't try to sabotage the mission for their own self-interest. Everyone was on board with the mission and they all had the same goal.

5.0,"The Martian movie is a dream come true, a faithful elucidation of the central technical dramas that made the Andy Weir novel it's based on the surprise ‘space geek hit' of the decade. The tale is something of a Robinson Crusoe in space: Astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates are forced to evacuate their habitat and blast off for Earth. Watney must improvise ways to eke out his limited resources, as the next mission to the red planet isn't scheduled to land for another four years. Like the book, the movie's rhythm is a steady cycle of crisis, recovery, humor, determination, and new crisis. On screen, directed by Ridley Scott, these cycles are delivered with satisfying characterization and eye-grabbing visuals of Martian landscapes and mouth-gaping zero-G gymnastics in space.

As a backdrop to the human drama (and comedy), the movie's hardware is based on real engineering, not magical miracle machines. The Hermes mother ship, for example, is a modified version of the sound design strategy of a ‘cycling spacecraft' that repeatedly makes the Earth-Mars-Earth loop with crew and small landing craft. (Buzz Aldrin and I wrote up the concept for Scientific American a decade ago.)


As the left-for-dead Watney, played by Matt Damon, faces doom in a dozen guises, he defiantly boosts his courage through styling himself as everything from the ""best botanist on Mars"" (as he ingeniously grows potatoes in carefully-created garden soil) to a ""space pirate"" (for his goal of commandeering a rescue rocket emplaced automatically elsewhere on the planet). He expresses his thoughts to his laptop log and later in messages to people on earth campaigning to rescue him. When humans finally reach other planets, we will need real ""Watneys""—those smart enough to repurpose on-hand assets in an emergency, and lucky enough not to be killed by their own inevitable oversights.



Space geeks will enjoy identifying and debating technical flaws in the film. The Martian follows its source material remarkably closely, but unlike say, certain installments in the Harry Potter movie franchise, it will still make perfect sense to those who haven't read the book. Aside from the monster sandstorm that sets up the crisis (Andy Weir, the author of The Martian, is very upfront about choosing to gloss over the realities of Martian atmospheric pressure in favor of a dramatic opening), there are few noticeable factual flubs in the plot. Unlike 2013's Gravity and its magical space maneuvers, or 2014's Interstellar with its mystical time continuum tricks, this movie is a remarkably authentic exposition of what space travelers need to be able to do under crisis conditions.

Run time constraints forced the movie's producers to condense and combine characters, with no real detriment to the story—although viewers might be surprised to see the same set of key NASA experts showing up at every launch or space center on the planet as the action shifts between continents. Similar story-telling imperatives probably compelled the most striking departure (spoiler alert!) from the book—changing who actually goes to rescue Watney in the end—but again, without any significant detour from the plot.

There's no cheating on even highly-technical spaceflight topics, as shown in the treatment of the so-called ""Rich Purnell maneuver,"" wherein the Hermes slingshots past Earth back to Mars for a desperate pickup attempt. NASA's navigation geek Purnell—played with effective nervous energy by Donald Glover— demonstrates the ""orbitology"" of his maneuver, with two NASA officials as the planets, and a stapler and pens as spacecraft. The result is coherent, comprehensive, and surprisingly comic. The basic strategy of the Rich Purnell maneuver is not fictional—a crippled Japanese Mars probe named Nozomi actually used a similar Earth-flyby scheme to set up a second chance for its own faltering unmanned Mars mission a dozen years ago.

There's one cringeworthy trope in The Martian that has apparently become an unavoidable cultural myth: the scenes where teams in Mission Control erupt into leaping cheers a few seconds after a rocket blasts off. This imaginary practice would not only be utterly unprofessional but also an indicator of near-criminal negligence. In the screening that I attended following an event at NASA's Johnson Space Center, these scenes were negatively noticed by many NASA folks in the audience. But I only can suppose it was sympathetically meant to humanize the rocket scientists, and it was the only exception to the admiration shown for all the other portrayals. (It's also possible this trope has been influenced by footage of the controllers of deep space unmanned missions in recent years, where data about events can take hours to cross the solar system, leaving controllers mostly in the position of spectators during key mission milestones.)

After faithfully reproducing technically-sound crises and responses for two hours, the movie did briefly run off the track into fantasy mode at the very end, by by violating the physics of action-reaction in portraying an over-dramatized dramatic rescue attempt that really didn't need any such cheating. But if that was the price to pay for producing this otherwise magnificent space adventure story, the math checked out. Mother Nature is relentlessly unforgiving in space, but a movie audience can show a lot more mercy to one major technical transgression.

3.0,Personal think movie was overrated. While some really cool scifi scenes the movie goes its slow pace in space and creates superficial tension often playing everything as joke that don't really stick. Compared to something like cast away where Tom hanks struggle to survive and feel desperation on his journey. Matt Damon is just a cool cat through out film fixing everything with such ease that never really gives us reason to want or need to cheer him on as he clearly doesn't need our support.

But of the pluses, I can safely name the excellent effects, a good share of humor and Matt Damon. Seriously, besides him, there is no one to mention from the actor's work. Supporting actors are all good, but there are so many characters that everyone who is not Matt Damon is simply lost. They simply do not have time to reveal, although the film lasts more than two hours. But then the character of Damon is on top.

However, I still put the film 4 stars. Nevertheless, there is in places a strong tension that makes us empathize with the hero, and there is an atmosphere.

This is a Matt Damon show and the actor is pretty much in the frame all through the running time as an astronaut stranded on the red planet. This is neither an action-oriented motion picture nor a special effects extravaganza. It's an introspective story about what it might be like to be the sole inhabitant of a distant world and knowing that instant communication isn't possible, and a rescue is at best a year away. It's also an examination of how necessity truly can be the mother of invention - not only for the survivor but for those on Earth seeking to find a way to save him.

4.0,"I knew this movie was coming for awhile, largely because of the names attached to it, and for that reason I knew it was a possible movie to see but wasn't going to be sure until I saw more about it.  As it got closer to the release, what I saw and heard about was mostly positive to very positive.  It had an early October release and I don't know if there is anything else I will venture to the theater for until mid to late December.  With it being a minimal risk due to the people involved(director - Ridley Scott, and starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, and others) it was a safe bet to not be a bad movie.


I went into it with no expectations, maybe because I knew it would be good.  I felt it was a solid trip to the movies with very few holes in my viewing experience, if any at all.  I liken the movie to a cross between Gravity/Castaway/Apollo 13/Mission to Mars and/or Red Planet, three of which were nominated or winners of awards... the previous Mars movies, not as good.  

For me, the movie starts as a 7 ½ of 10 but fails to get much higher due in large part to it being what you think it would be and not extremely big on surprises or twists and turns.  On the right day, this could be an 8 - 8 ½ for a lot of people, on a bad day people might fall asleep in the theater and have to go with an ‘incomplete.'  I'm going give it an 8 ½ of 10 because I think it might be a movie that gets better when watching it at home.

2.5,"This ‘comedy' charmed and excited the audiences of 2015 enough that the Academy gave it a Best Picture nomination. It's a fine film but hardly deserving of all the over the top praise it receives and certainly not one of the finest films of 2015, although it was an admittedly weak year. The visual effects are impressive and the direction and performances are serviceable if not brilliant. This film was a return to form for director Ridley Scott after the failure of The Counselor (2013) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) and he does a decent job at blending science fiction and comedy but it pales in comparison to his best. Go in expecting an average film made by people capable of producing something much greater.

Astronaut Mark Watney, Matt Damon, is stranded on Mars after he is lost by his team during a dust storm and they are able to evacuate without him. He sets up a sustainable lifestyle for himself on Mars in the HAB while he attempts to contact earth as the other members of his team, led by Melissa Lewis, Jessica Chastain, are not told of his survival despite their superiors being aware. When they do eventually find out due to a strange subplot about the Chinese they return to rescue him and lead successful lives when they return to earth.

The movie looks beautiful as most Scott films do and the wide shots of Mars are marvelous as you really get a sense of how large the canvas that Scott is working on is. That wasn't enough to make me like the film however and because the movie is fairly thin on character development and portrayal of personal struggle in the characters I did find it hard to enjoy the film in a way that was not shallow. Even 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) which features minimal dialogue and is mostly just shots of the most unbelievable visuals you have ever set your eyes upon makes you care about Dave, or humanity, in his plight to survive. Of course I don't expect this film to equal one of the greatest films of all time but I needed it to make me feel something instead of just mild pleasure and occasional amusement.

The two leads, Damon and Chastain, can both be fantastic and have appeared in several great films but they do have a tendency to be rather stolid when not given much to work with. They appear that way here as their characters seem almost robotic in how hyper competent they are while lacking in personality completely and although occasional lines about disco add some flavor to the characters we never really feel for them. You can pick out several notable actors amongst the film's supporting cast as Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig and Mackenzie Davis get very little do and this can at times feel frustrating as I would hope that you could find less talented people to fill roles that require so little.

A lot has been made of Goddard's screenplay and how ingeniously it blends popular science and humor. I think it deserved it's Best Screenplay nomination as 2015 wasn't the best year, for mainstream cinema, but it didn't pack the punch of a film like Galaxy Quest (1999). Again, I liked it but I was never surprised by anything that occurred, no real tension was built up and nothing about it made me really laugh, cry or have any emotional response. I needed to feel one of those things in order for this film to be anything above average in my mind and it proved itself again and again to be good but not great.

Would I recommend this film? No. It's not good enough for me to tell someone it's worth watching because there are better films that do everything that this film does but better. Ridley Scott made one of the greatest films of all time in Blade Runner (1982) and a feminist classic in Thelma & Louise (1991), Matt Damon gives a brilliant performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Jessica Chastain lights up the screen in A Most Violent Year (2014), these are all films I would recommend before even mentioning The Martian.",Catherine S,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Jun 03, 2019",Catherine S,/user/id/977990772,RT,977990772,,The Martian

4.0,"There can't be a greater story device then that of basic survival. One character battles against the elements as their life hangs by the slender thread solely dependent on their own ingenuity and wit. That's the crux of Ridley Scott's adaptation of The Martian, a bold and exhilarating red-blooded adventure about a man stranded on the Martian surface 143,000,000 miles from home who must use every resource he has to keep himself alive until somebody comes to pick him up. It's bold, it's fun, it's smart, it's ingenious, and it contains the only montage I've ever seen of a man scrapping a space capsule while ABBA's ""Waterloo"" plays on the soundtrack.

Based on the book by Andy Weir, The Martian tells a story that is simplistic but not simple-minded: The crew of Ares III, a manned mission to Mars, find themselves overwhelmed by a nasty rock storm that forces the crew to evacuate the planet. In the chaos of the blinding wind one crew member is lost and presumed dead. It's now or never, so the crew has to make a hasty escape and reasonably assumes that their crew member has fallen. Of course, he hasn't. As the crew head for home, our hero Mark Whatley (Matt Damon) wakes up the next day on the planet's surface with his oxygen depleted, and a piece of the antenna sticking out of his abdomen.

Shades of Cast Away, Mark discovers that he is the only man on Mars and not only must figure out a way to survive but must also figure out a rational reason to keep talking (Tom Hanks had a volleyball, Damon has easier device of talking to his video log). He moves into the crew's abandoned man-made habitat where he calculates how much food, water and air he will have to sustain himself for the next four years until the next scheduled Mars mission, arrives on the planet's surface.

This is where the movie gets interesting. Mark discovers that he has enough food and water for a few weeks, and ascertains that he must figure a way to grow more. But how is he going to plant a garden on a dry planet with no air. This solution is inspired. Plus - good news kids - He's a botanist!

Much of the movie is taken up with Mark's adventure in pure survival not only from the hostile environment, but also from the maddening fact that the only music left behind is Disco (That's why the ABBA song). Step by step, piece by piece we're with him as he carves out a tiny civilization for himself on a planet that is dead-set against it. The script pays close attention to thoughtful reasonable questions like what would happen if the faceplate on Mark's spacesuit got cracked? How do you manufacture water in an airtight environment? How can he make contact with Earth when his communication devices were destroyed by the storm? (for that he creates a crude form of ASCII code that is simply inspired) Each new problem becomes a brain exercise for Mark that keeps his mind sharp. Never for a second is any of this dull or uninteresting. The script by Drew Goddard keeps things moving and always ups that stakes. The irony, of course, is that while Mark is forced to close himself up inside the tiny habitat, outside are the wide open spaces of the Martian landscape. The cinematography here is breathtaking, showing us the vastness of the Martian landscapes which look so beautiful and yet so lonely at the same time.

Of course, that's not the whole story. There are two other parts to this movie. One takes place on the ground as the crew at NASA gets a cryptic message from Mark that he is alive and well. Then - shades of Apollo 13 - they must put their collective heads together to figure out how to retrieve their man from 140,000,000 miles away over the next four years. Again, none of this is ever dull or uninteresting. We get the pure joy of watching smart people coming up with smart solutions.

The other part takes place aboard the returning ship - the one that left Mark behind. We are privy to the crew - led by Jessica Chastain - as they must figure out how they are going to be able to turn the ship around and go back and get him. Of course, that means another four years onboard the ship, plus how are they going to retrieve him when they get there? Everything, in all three parts of this story is based on surgical timing. If one thing goes wrong, the crew could be lost, Mark could be dead and the whole thing could become an international fiasco back home.

All of this, of course, leads up to a third act that - while predictable - has you on the edge of your seat. It's rare in these days when most movies go on automatic pilot in the third act that we are just as exhilarated by the third act as we were by the first or the second. What is so thrilling here is that director Ridley Scott and his screenwriter Drew Goddard avoid phony manipulation. They don't manufacture extraneous drama or throw in unnecessary subplots that weigh the story down. There is no villain here, no naysayer. Mark's situation is all the villain that you need. Plus, unlike last year's Intersteller, the movie doesn't drown itself in emotional syrup. Yeah, it's tragic that Mark is stuck in this place, but for the most part, this is an upbeat movie. It is also nice that the motivation of the people at NASA and the crew aboard Ares III isn't solely based on politics. They're doing this because it's the right thing to do.

What an exhilarating movie this is. What fun it is to watch smart people trying to figure out a nearly impossible task. It's rare that a movie of this size - and it is a big movie - can keep us so totally involved in what is going on at every single second. Like Gravity and Apollo 13, this is a movie about a dangerous situation that has us riveted at every single moment.  We know the ending but we're not sure how the movie is going to get there.

5.0,"How could a futuristic, highly-technical story of isolation on the Red Planet connect with an earthbound reader? Well, at times we all endure isolation, solitary confinement, and feelings of being lost. The question is how to work within the given circumstances and not give-up hope? It's a universal story of over-coming, perseverance, teamwork, and bravery. In the first 20% of the book and the film, one learns that Mark Watney is determined, relentless, and content in any and every situation. Then really bad sh*t starts happening! His communication is in the form of a (daily log) diary, and the effect is eavesdropping on the anxious, personal ramblings of a lost astronaut on Mars. The feelings of being lost, misunderstood, and hopeless affect all of us at some point, so it is easy to relate to Mark Watney. His intelligence, humor, courage, tenacity, and wit are essential to survival; but most of all, he won't quit, despite facing almost impossible odds of long-term existence or rescue. What originally started as free posts by a nerdy blogger, and then small increments posted on Amazon for $0.99/per chapter, turned into this bestseller, which really picks up its pace when NASA discovers his movements on Mars (even though they thought he was dead) and begins to plan a rescue mission. All forms of botany, hygiene, communication, repair, and maintenance go out the window in a desperate attempt to save one man's life, at all costs. The problem-solving alone keeps the pages turning as fast as the oxygen is depleted from his EVA suit. It's kind of like Unbroken, Castaway, and Apollo 13 (movies) combined to make this story one of the most gritty, compelling, suspenseful, and realistic novels I've read in a long time. Speaking of movies, the epic film directed by Ridley Scott in 2015 stays lock-step with the book's rhythm, and for a movie largely based in technical details given in soliloquy, it does a masterful telling of the story with only minor changes. Kudos to Drew Goddard for the Screenplay. Matt Damon is a perfect Mark Watney! And for any lonely soul whose felt ""cut-off"" in severe isolation, in whatever human condition, whether his fault or as part of an attack of bad luck; this character, Mark Watney, botanist astronaut, space pirate, Capt. Longbeard, will soon become your long lost hero. He is a life-force for the ages, and even though the logistics of his rescue are a bit technical, the flow is powerful and engaging.

Yes, this is one of the best casts I can recall seeing in any movie. Ridley Scott was a fantastic choice for a director. He just seems to get these space films, doesn't he? The script is intelligent and does a tremendous job balancing the serious notes with a surprising amount of comedy. This is way funnier than you'd expect. The special effects are very well done and make good use of the film's budget. Obviously, the emotional connection to Mark is a key to the movie, but it's just so interesting to watch him do whatever he can to make life on another planet work. That is enough to keep you enthralled until the closing credits. The big scene where Mark reunites with his crew in an effort to try and return to Earth is thrilling and filed with tense beats.

Weaknesses: It's understandable why this is nearly two and a half hours, but it's one of those movies that feels like it. You certainly feel that things are going long at points. It's probably a weird thing to nitpick, but the sound was off in this. I found myself struggling to hear several characters in various scenes, despite the volume being fine in other parts. Also, for some of Mark's scientific exploits to work, believability needs to be stretched. Some things just so happen to be in places that benefit him and it feels like somewhat of a stretch. 

Overall: Despite a few minor flaws, this movie ultimately works in many ways. Matt Damon is a terrific lead in a very demanding role. The rest of the cast delivers in their smaller roles in spades. It does a good job balancing the meat of the story on Mars with the intrigue of how this gets handled down on Earth.

5.0,"It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why: 

Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts! 

Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners (""My balls are frozen!"") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, ""Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you."" (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, ""Yes!"" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation. 

Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake! 

AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here.In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).

As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.

Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years.You know how I said that blockbusters are one-note, generic and have no personality whatsoever?

Luckily, legendary director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard said ""Forget this formula!"" and decided to adapt a nerdy sci-fi novel to the big screen. And what do I think of it?

I LOVE IT! Wanna know why? Well, let's focus on the story first.

While on a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and a crew of astronauts decided to abandon mission when a storm happens. However, Watney gets hit by a satellite. Because of the storm and the lack of time, they immediately decide to leave Mars, believing that Watney is dead. But surprise surprise, he's actually alive and well. You see, he actually knocked out cold and part of the satellite damaged his bio-monitor (which actually explains why the crew couldn't find him, aside from the storm). Left alone on Mars, he decides that he's not gonna die and solves problems in order to survive. 

However on Earth, a bunch of images cause NASA to realise, ""Uh-oh, we messed up!"" and do everything in their power to help him. The result is a 2 hr 20 min adventure full of suspense, problem-solving and laughs that will even make a robot interested.

Now why do I adore this movie? Well, there are lots, but I'll just put out my main reasons.

1. Mark Watney. Like characters such as Andy DuFresne, Barry Egan and Michael Sullivan, Watney is one of my favourite characters of all time. In fact, the whole film will basically be nothing without him. The reason why I like him so much is because that he's a character who actually DOES something other than look pretty. He grows potatoes in poop and Martian soil, He uses duck tape to fix both his helmet and a broken door, and travels in a rover for days to search what he is looking for. He solves problems. He has a sense of humour. He feels like he's having FUN in space. He doesn't mope around mourning about the fact that he is trapped in Mars. Hell, the only thing that is sort of torturing him is God awful disco music. He's everything a great character should be. In an era where a main character does nothing but look good and does nothing else, Watney is the like the rebuttal of all bland main characters today. He is such a great character, I could talk for days about why I love him so much.

2. The supporting cast. Again, They actually do something aside from looking good. You got actors like Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. They all could have been underused in a regular blockbuster. But the screenplay has so much energy, it gives the cast something to do. They sit down, talk, debate about their plans, calculate on how Watney's gonna survive, tell sarcastic jokes, etc. You get the feeling these are people that are just doing their job instead of being bad guys. That's MUCH more interesting than just the same aul tripe we get in regular blockbusters. That is something I want. A film that focuses more on character and story than just blowing stuff up. I would stop there, but there's a lot more good in this movie

3. The screenplay and direction. It has personality. Again, that's something I want in a movie! The screenplay is part-comedy, part-drama, part sci-fi, part sci-fact, all nerdy to a degree. Drew Goddard wrote the sh*t out of this. Although it's adapted from a novel, Goddard has written something sharp, focused (even if it lasted for 2 hours and 21 minutes) and cooked perfectly to a degree and Ridley Scott only made it even better. Not only does he have a knack for visuals (which are good as always), but Scott also gives out the best performances from his actors. It feels like the actors truly give a damn about the script. This is one of those movies where even the subplots are the best parts.

4. The score. My god, the score is amazing! It doesn't attempt to sound Zimmer- like. Instead it sounds heroic, beautiful, powerful and memorable to a degree. Harry Gregson-Williams created a score that sounds like a Boards of Canada album got eaten up by a Jonny Greenwood composition and surprisingly it works.

Overall, the Martian is a great movie. It has everything I ever wanted in a movie released in today's Nolan-ridden era. It's definitely an anti-Nolan movie. It's fun. It has consistency. The characters aren't mopey. It's very nerdy. It wastes NO time and goes straight to the point even at 2 hours and 21 minutes. Hands down, it's not only one of the best of 2015, but also one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. It's Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner and a comeback that is definitely worth the wait. 

The best part? The whole film is even funnier than the revenge after 400 years bit from Exodus: Gods and Kings.

Simply put, if you're tired of all the dark, gritty and absolutely bland blockbusters, SEE THE MARTIAN ALREADY! It's out now! I saw it two times already! What are you waiting for? Go already! Skip school to see this! Skip work to see this! Don't even bother downloading it! Get your a** to mars already! This one that you must see in the cinema and trust me, it's a rewarding experience. ;)",Anzaan A,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 24, 2017",Anzaan A,/user/id/976860644,RT,976860644,,The Martian
4.0,"After Mark Watney is hit by debris during a storm on Mars, his crew is forced to leave him behind, presuming him dead. Mark awakes alone on Mars and has to use his skills as a botanist to survive until he can be rescued and brought home to earth. 
Matt Damon is truly excellent as Mark Watney, even though he spends the majority of the film alone he manages to carry this movie with a great deal of humour, drama and taps into some very emotional moments. Jessica Chastain is also good as Commander Lewis and her and the other actors playing the rest of her crew have great chemistry together. Back at NASA headquarters, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Benedict Wong, Sean Bean and a number of other excellent actors play off each other well and keep the plot moving forward.
Considering a huge amount of the film is about scientific/mathematical calculations and growing potatoes , this is an incredibly entertaining film. There is a nice balance between drama and comedy and the scientific parts of the film are quite interesting, managing to simply explain what they are doing whilst not grinding the pace of the film to a halt. The film overall is a little on the long side and some of the obstacles or conversations at NASA could have been cut but the film still manages to maintain a level of tension and jeopardy about Watney's rescue.
The Martian is also beautifully shot with a great soundtrack. The use of pop music, explained by the use of the commander's CDS is also a nice touch an plays up some of the more comedic moments. The scenes inside the Hermes are also very well shot and look very convincing as the crew floats through moving parts of the ship as well as the scenes in space.
To summarise, this is an interesting, thrilling and surprisingly funny film in which people come together to save one man and as is often the case, that man in Matt Damon.

4.5,"""Everywhere I go I'm the first. It's a strange feeling. Step outside the rover, first guy to be there. Climb that hill, first guy to do that. Four and a half billion years, nobody here. And now...me."" - Mark Watney, ""The Martian""

Imagine you're the first person to be alone on an entire planet. You're in a NASA exploration habitat that was built to last for 31 days. Your food supply is limited. If the oxygenator breaks, you'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, you'll die of thirst. If the habitat is breached, you'll implode. What do you do? How do you survive? Is it possible to make it back home? For astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), dying is not an option.

You'd think a story about one man's fight for survival on a planet several million years away from Earth would be bleak, but this return to form for director Ridley Scott is anything but. ""The Martian"" is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, largely due to Drew Goddard's adapted screenplay and Damon's perfect execution of the sarcastic spaceman Mark Watney.

Each time something goes wrong, Watney delivers a line that showcases his optimism and comedic nature. One of my favorite lines comes a little over halfway into the movie, when Watney is forced to ration his food into smaller portions. As he eats a piece of meat the size of a Lego block and half of a red potato, he stares at the camera blankly and says: ""It's been seven days since I ran out of ketchup.""

While humorous moments like this are sprinkled throughout the film, Damon also captures the underlying despair and loneliness felt by Watney, and his desire to get back home.

The scene that hooked me comes right after Watney is marooned on the red planet. As a massive dust storm rages outside of the habitat, a defeated Watney looks through some of the belongings his crew left behind. Staring off into the darkness, he confidently mutters, ""I'm not gonna die here.""

Damon's performance is complimented by those of a large supporting cast consisting of Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, who play members of Watney's crew and the NASA men and women trying to get him home.

When Watney says, ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers,"" you believe him. His scientific wit is as entertaining as his humor, and you're for rooting for Watney each step of the way. You cheer with each success, and empathize with each failure.

Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski bring the desolate wasteland of Mars to life. Scott and Wolski create beauty from the barren world, and with each shot, the vast desert further contributes to the sense of isolation you feel while sitting in the theater.

""The Martian"" stands among Ridley Scott's best work, and Matt Damon provides one of his greatest performances. The scientific wonder the film evokes transcends both of their contributions however, and I am excited to see where we as humans progress in the coming years.

With several Mars-based projects currently being pursued by NASA as well as advancing technological developments, the future looks bright. Hopefully in our lifetime we will have the chance to witness history.

5.0,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I feel like Jan Brady:  Martian, Martian, MARTIAN!   

SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Only one Martian, Greg. Not a bunch. And he s My Favorite Martian. Let s recap.

GREG: We re introduced to Matt Watney (Matt Damon) who is on an away mission to Mars with his 7 fellow astronauts. They are all gathering dirt and samples when a storm starts a-brewin . So they rush back to the ship as the storm starts getting rough. So rough, in fact that a satellite dish goes flying and hits our boy. The rest of the team make it to the rocket and they reluctantly take off without him, thinking he s dead.

SCOTT: Turns out that Watney survived the mishap and is now stranded on the red planet. He calculates that he has about a year s worth of food supplies but must somehow survive three years until the next manned mission to Mars arrives. Being a botanist, Watney uses his skills to begin planting crops inside his habitat shelter. Meanwhile NASA scientists discover from photographs of the planet that Watney is alive, and they begin communicating with him. Soon they hatch a daring effort to rescue Watney before he starves to death.

GREG: Scott, The Martian is another in a series of smart, scientifically accurate, science fiction movies (following 2013 s Gravity and last year s Interstellar). The Martian puts you right in the action. You immediately care about Watney s situation and you root for him to succeed. When everything goes south on him we all feel his anguish. If you notice that I m talking a lot about feelings in this review, it s for good reason. The science isn t only what s showcased here, it s the emotions of Watney on Mars, and his compatriots on the spaceship above, and his peers at Mission Control back on Earth. I was struck by how the screenwriter (Drew Goddard ) and director (Ridley Scott) kept three different storylines running at once. That makes for a fantastic story.

SCOTT: The Martian is an extraordinary hero story, perhaps the best I ve seen on the big screen in several years. The movie itself is almost as strong as the hero s journey; it explodes off the screen, seizing our attention and lifting our hearts for the entire 2 hours and 21 minutes. We have the complete package here: a riveting screenplay, a terrific cast, astounding CGI effects, and a gritty hero worthy of our greatest admiration. The only element of the hero s journey that is missing is a  mentor  figure. My thinking is that there are  implied  mentors   all the teachers and trainers who taught him skills in science and survival. The end of the movie, showing him become that teacher to others, drives home that point. We saw that kind of implied mentor in A Walk in the Woods, where Robert Redford s character reveals the influence of Henry David Thoreau.

GREG: Scott, what you re describing could be  The Mentor s Journey.  We ve seen this in other stories. The last role for the hero is to become a mentor; to share his lessons learned with new and upcoming heroes. In The Hunger Games Haymitch is just such a mentor. He was once a tribute for the Hunger Games and he survived by killing off all the other tributes. As such, he became a hero figure. Now, in his twilight days, he passes on what he has learned to newer tributes. His final destination as a hero is to become a mentor. I felt there were a lot of heroes in this story. Of course there s Watney on Mars. But there are other lesser heroes. There is the director of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) who has three underlings who act as henchmen (Henderson, Ng, and Moontrose). While he manages the operation, it s the other three who do the dirty work. We also see a turncoat in Henderson. He defies Sanders and informs the crew. This may be a new secondary character - the Unreliable Henchman. Up on spaceship Ares, there is a crew of followers lead by Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). They are also following the Mastermind/Henchman pattern. I d also like to draw your attention to two characters who represent a new kind of secondary character for us - the Ingenious Youngster. In one case we have a young woman, Mindy Park, who spots Watney on the satellite photos. In the next, is the young orbital mechanics scientist Purnell (Donald Glover) who figures out how to get Watney home. Both of these underlings are far down in the hero hierarchy, but without them, the story ends sadly.

SCOTT: You re right, Greg, in pointing out the importance of the young kid character who unexpectedly saves the day by solving a problem that his (or her) elders cannot. In Star Trek: The Next Generation, it was Wesley Crusher who bailed out the Enterprise on more than one occasion. Here it is Purnell, a neophyte astrophysicist whose computations allow for the possibility for the crew to perform a slingshot maneuver around the sun to expedite a return trip to Mars to save Watney. This whiz-kid character stands in direct contrast to the archetypal Wise Old Man or Woman character who usually serves as the mentor. How interesting that heroes can get help from all different types of sources, some expected and others unexpected. I suspect that villains can receive assistance from a similar range of characters, although The Martian is not the right movie to test this hypothesis. There is no human villain in the story; the villain is nature itself, specifically, the inhospitable natural conditions endemic to Mars.

GREG: Which brings up an interesting question in this story - who is the villain for the secondary characters? It would seem it is time. NASA is running out of time before their window of opportunity closes. The astronauts aboard spaceship Ares are also fighting against the time it takes to turn around and go back after Watney. Also, the director of NASA plays a bit of the villain too, as he weighs the expense of losing one man on Mars, versus an entire crew in a rescue attempt. In his mind, better to lose one man than a whole ship and its crew. Perhaps budgets and finance are a villain for him? The Martian is a great story told exceedingly well. The three plotlines dovetail nicely to give us what some have called Apollo 13 on steroids. The science in this movie has won praises from all corners. The special effects made me believe I was on Mars. But more than that, the tension in this movie is unrelenting. I couldn t look away for a second for fear I d miss something important. I give The Martian 5 out of 5 Reels. There are heroes a-plenty in this movie. Watney, of course, is the main character and is the hero of his plotline. But the other two plotlines have heroic characters at all levels of the story. Even in China we meet two scientists who risk their reputations and status to help rescue Watney. As for Watney, he is the ultimate hero. He s physically capable and the most competent man on the planet. He uses all his knowledge and experience to survive in the harshest of environments. He gets a full 5 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the enormous cast of secondary characters is just overwhelming. We see two sets of Mastermind/Henchman hierarchies. Everyone from the top down is working at their peak to get Watney home. The cast is diverse in every way. We even found a new supporting character in the young geniuses. I give the supporting cast 5 out of 5 cast points.  Movie:  Cast: Heroes:

SCOTT: Greg, nothing displeases me more than agreeing with you, but I have to concur with you across the board. The Martian is a near-flawless movie that deserves both critical acclaim and box office success. I hope this film gets recognized with numerous nominations at Oscar time. It s both a no-brainer and a pleasure to award the full 5 Reels out of 5 to The Martian. The hero story is textbook. Watney travels the full hero s journey, and in every phase of the journey we witness a richness and depth that is rarely seen in the movies. Watney shows all eight characteristics in the Great Eight traits of heroes: He is smart, strong, inspiring, reliable, resilient, caring, selfless, and charismatic. He becomes transformed from ordinary astronaut to an exceptionally innovative, pioneering colonist who rises to the challenge of surviving where no human has any right to survive. Clearly, Watney earns the full 5 Heroes out of 5 here. And as you mention, Greg, the secondary characters possess a similar richness and depth, and they do exactly what secondary characters should do in any great movie. They complement the hero, assist him, wrong him at times (albeit unintentionally), and enjoy their own mini-journeys of discovery, despair, and triumph. This impressive cadre of supporting characters no doubt earn a rating of 5 out of 5.  Movie:  Cast: Heroes:

GREG: I don t think films get much better than this. I d like to nominate The Martian for the coveted Reel Heroes Hall of  Fame. What do you say?

SCOTT: The Hall of Fame is rarified air, Gregger. But I have to agree with you. This movie is a remarkable gem, and so I second your nomination. It s Hall of Fame material for sure.",Reel H,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Aug 16, 2017",Reel H,/user/id/976625758,RT,976625758,,The Martian

Regardless, it's good entertainment and mostly keeps you interested, largely thanks to Matt Damon's charismatic performance as the titular character. The movie definitely drags in parts and needed some trimming, it needed to be about 20 minutes shorter.

Matt Damon really carries the story, making the protagonist charming and easy to root for. I'm not sure of how accurate the science really is but it was convincing to me without feeling like we were sitting in on a science lecture. The film is beautiful to look at.

I am going to start off by saying that The Martian was remarkable. I have so much good to say about it.
The script was top-notch. It stayed true to the survival sub-genre. At any point, you can expect anything to happen to the character. The dialogue is also exceptionally good.
Matt Damon gives one of his best performances yet as Mark Watney. You can tell that he is giving this role his all. He hasn't been this good in a movie sense the Borne trilogy.
The Mars setting honestly couldn't've been any better. Riley Scott  knew what he was doing when he brought this film to life. Everything was close to flawless.

3.0,"The Martian
        	Now I've only seen 7 out of 22 of Ridley Scott's movies. And for the most part I've been Indifferent towards Ridley Scott's movies. And sometimes he'll come out with something that I really like, but truth be told I've only liked 2 of his movies and I like I said I haven't seen all his movies. One movie I need to revisit of his would be ""Blade Runner"" since I saw the Director's Cut of that and ""The Martian"" may be a movie that I need to see the director's cut of. But if there isn't one then this is one movie that I don't think I need to revisit.
One thing I was thoroughly surprised by was the fact that this movie was written by Drew Goddard the creator and main writer for the new ""Daredevil"" series on Netflix. And he actually wrote this movie really well even though it was a little contrived. The plot of ""The Martian"" is one where it's a very intense story of survival. Matt Damon is alone on Mars. He has no friends, very little food and he needs to find a way to stay alive until help arrives to BRING HIM HOME!
""The Martian"" is like a combination of the movie ""Gravity"" and ""Cast Away."" And while ""Cast Away"" and ""Gravity"" were both interesting movies for different reasons I can't really say that a combination of those movies worked for ""The Martian."" I'd like to talk more about Gravity, but I'd rather save that for another time.
One thing I didn't particularly like about The Martian was that it didn't really have a lot of tension between characters other than when Matt Damon was typing out his crass complaints live to the entire world. I thought the movie would have been more engaging than it could have been with some conflict between the characters. And even though I was engaged the entire time I think that it was mostly due to the fact that the survival elements were enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. 
The idea of someone being stranded alone on a planet waiting for help to come is a good idea for a story right? Damn straight it is. But the thing that I thought ""The Martian"" relied WAY too heavily on was all the stuff that went wrong for Mark Watney and there wasn't enough conflict between the characters. And when there was conflict between the characters it was resolved almost instantly. And as for the things that went wrong for Mark what I mean by that is this: With Mark's garden blowing up and his food running short I noticed that those were the MAIN THINGS that fueled this movie and kept it afloat. And usually those scenes came after scenes where you thought things were going okay and then something bad happened.
Keeping warm for Mark wasn't a big problem because the temperature on Mars is livable and he found his warm Uranium thingy, but for the most part I just felt bad for him since he was going to starve on Mars and they SHOWED IT. They showed that he was starving and that he didn't have a lot to eat. Especially near the end when he was skin and bones. But as soon as the movie was over I was in no rush to see it again. I thought that Matt Damon did a great job as usual. And this redeemed Mr Damon after his shitty role as Dr. Mann in ""Interstellar"".
""The Martian"" had almost no tension between any of the characters. And when it did happen the tension was there for less than a minute and that in and of itself was frustrating because people don't just end arguments so quickly. Not over little things and not even when someone's life is on the line. I'm sure that if something like ""The Martian"" were happening in real life right in this moment the world would probably be debating whether or not we should save him and whether we should spend millions of dollars in tax-payers money to save one man. And plus the part in this movie where China agrees to help out the United States in bringing him back is quite baffling to me.
I don't think it was entirely a bad thing to have made the story mostly one of survival I also think that if they were going to make it one of survival that it needed to be even more intense than it was. And I'm not talking like gunfire, explosions or monsters or anything like that. But I think that Ridley Scott should have made it even harder on Mark Whatney. I don't know how that could have happened, but that was the screenwriter's job and Drew Goddard didn't do as well as I would have hoped in that sense. But Drew Goddard is a fantastic writer and I'm very much looking forward to whatever he has in the works that's coming out next.
""The Martian"" was not bad, but honestly it just wasn't exciting enough and I don't think it was as good as it could have been. I don't want to see ""The Martian"" again. I have no desire to. If I was invited to some event where ""The Martian"" was going to be shown and I didn't have to pay then I'd probably go if there was nothing better to do at home.

4.0,"Almost zany in its attempt to deliver a castaway story on Mars, its meandering tone and pace are refreshing in such a serious, heady genre and is probably the happiest film about space (are there really any happy films about space?), particularly being lost in space. The cheesy disco soundtrack helps fuel this slightly lighthearted feeling throughout and is also bolstered by the cameo of Kristen Wiig, mostly known for her dry and darkly comic roles and proves once again that she can lighten up the bleakest of films. The Martian is not a comedy, but nor is it a thriller. It's a genuinely brilliant story, however. Matt Damon's brilliant performance grounds the film throughout and is constant, committed and extremely well executed. Damon doesn't seem to take the role too seriously and this is a good thing, however is performance is undeniably believable. Jessica Chastain is also a perfect compliment to Damon's presence, providing a cosmic yin yang chemistry.

3.5,"In real life, space travel is a very dangerous undertaking, but more often than not everything goes as planned. In movies, however, when characters venture into outer space, disaster is inevitable. I can't think of any movies set in space where something does not go wrong. The Martian is no different in that respect, but in many other ways it is quite exceptional. 

In the first moments of the film, the crew of Ares 3 must make an emergency evacuation from Mars as a dangerous storm heads toward their mission site. In the midst of the storm, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by flying debris and thrown far from the escape vehicle. Presuming Watney to be dead, the rest of the crew launches and begins their trip back to Earth; Watney awakes to find himself injured and alone on Mars. He makes his way back to the mission's living habitat and immediately starts figuring out how he is going to survive on a lifeless planet with very limited supplies until the next Ares mission arrives or a rescue mission can be sent, either of which would not be possible for at least three or four years.    

Though Damon is all alone for the scenes on Mars, The Martian is not entirely a one man show like the survival films Cast Away or All is Lost. Once Watney is able to reestablish communications with NASA and let them know he is alive, we see the scientists and administrators at NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) rally to find solutions to keep Watney alive and get him home. The team on Earth is made up of a great ensemble of familiar and lesser known actors including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Mackenzie Davis, and Benedict Wong. We also check in with the other five members of the Ares 3 crew: Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Michael Peña, and Jessica Chastain. Jeff Daniels, as the head of NASA, and Jessica Chastain, as Ares 3's commander, are both stand-outs playing competent, pragmatic, and decisive leaders. Between his performances in The Martian and in Steve Jobs as Apple president John Sculley (for which he should've received a Supporting Actor nomination), Daniels had a pretty good 2015. Chastain, no stranger to playing strong, badass characters, might be a bit young to be a mission commander, but she is completely believable as a good leader with natural authority. I know that if I were going to Mars, I'd feel secure with her as my mission commander.

What sets The Martian apart from other science fiction movies is its heavy emphasis on science. It is based on a novel by Andy Weir which began as a blog in which Weir would present a problem facing an astronaut stranded on Mars, then research and post a solution. If one of his readers noticed something was incorrect or just seemed amiss, he would go back and fix the inaccuracy. The film adaptation's scientific accuracy has received the approval of NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, and for science enthusiasts (a.k.a. geeks) like myself, this is very exciting. However, whether or not everything in the film is 100% accurate is not as important as how problem solving and the scientific method are portrayed. Each life-threatening problem that Watney faces on Mars is entirely likely and the solutions are plausible. There's no moment where a character just tries something dangerous and hopes for the best-all the dangerous behavior in The Martian is backed up by meticulous calculations. I've never heard so many lines in a movie about how the math ""checks out."" 

Perhaps most important of all, and most accurate to real scientific problem solving, is how Watney's rescue is a team effort. Science is about solving a problem in the best and most efficient way possible, and the characters in The Martian know that means putting several minds to work and accepting help. Watney solves the problems of living on Mars with the help of the people at NASA and JPL and uses the things left behind by his fellow crew members to help him survive (like the wood from a crucifix to start a fire). In an act of international cooperation between scientists-not governments-the head of the Chinese Space Agency volunteers their rocket booster to help send Watney a delivery of food and supplies. And it is a young, eccentric scientist working in Astrodynamics for another NASA mission (Donald Glover) who comes up with the daring plan to get Watney home. 


Matt Damon has no one to act against in his scenes on Mars, but he still gives an engaging, lively performance that fills out all of his scenes and keeps the movie's pace flowing steadily. Through his video logs he indirectly addresses the audience which is an obvious, but effective, way to engage viewers and let us know what Watney is doing and why. His scenes on Mars are compelling and funny, too-demonstrating that having a positive attitude is important to persevering through any life-or-death situation. The Martian caught a lot of flak from critics for being submitted to the Golden Globe Awards as a comedy, but it is a pretty funny movie. Watney makes jokes and wisecracks throughout the film, which Damon is great at delivering. Perhaps in addition to raising interest in science, The Martian will also make people realize that science fiction does not always have to be dark and dour.

The Martian presents science fiction in a way we rarely see done successfully: as a non-esoteric, engaging blend of real science and entertainment. I loved the pro-science message of The Martian and I hope it does get people more interested in science and the universe. I enjoyed The Martian when I saw it in theaters, but when I watched it again recently...I loved it. I wish this movie were a stronger contender for Best Picture and I think I'll always be surprised that Ridley Scott did not receive a nomination for Best Director. Every shot of The Martian brims with serious, honest effort and execution and at the helm is Ridley Scott. Damon managed to snag an Oscar nomination for Best Actor which he is unfortunately unlikely to win, but which he completely deserves. 

In Interstellar, my favorite movie of 2014, Damon played an astronaut whom others believed to represent ""the best of us;"" however, when put to the test, he demonstrated the worst sides of human nature. The characters in The Martian, are truly the best of us because they are able to put aside selfish impulses and rise to the occasion when a fellow human is in need. It is an ideal vision of NASA, but an immensely satisfying one. Everyone snaps into action, puts their brains to work, and sets aside self-interests-even if it means accepting help from other countries--and works together. If there ever is a manned mission to Mars, I imagine that it will bear many similarities to the expedition presented in The Martian; and hopefully, unlike the fictional mission, the real mission will be disaster-free. However, if you were stuck on Mars, you'd want people like the characters in The Martian working to keep you alive and get you home.",Armando G,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Feb 19, 2017",Armando G,/user/id/784622113,RT,784622113,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10905656/picture,The Martian

5.0,"An astronaut's greatest fear: being left alone in space. There's nobody to keep you company -- nobody to keep you alive. Nothing to rely on but human instinct and, of course, potatoes. We humans rarely find ourselves in ideal situations. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is forced into a particularly problematic situation in Ridley Scott's 2015 movie, The Martian. He's stranded on Mars, impaled by an antenna, and presumed dead by all of earth. Not to mention an insufficient food supply and no way to phone home. But Mark's a botanist, and these are problems that a botanist is trained to solve. This movie must be seen by anyone who, like myself, loves great adventures that exhibit the wonders of science and the tenacity of human ingenuity.
    The plot is relatively straightforward. The 6 person crew of the Ares 3 mission are busy performing experiments and engaging in some lively banter when they are alerted (a little too late) to an oncoming martian dust storm of death. They decide that they need to abandon the mission and blast away from Mars lest their rocket get destroyed by the storm. But in the dark chaos of the storm, some debris hits Mark Watney and throws him back out of sight, The crew leaves him there, presumably dead. But he isn't. He wakes up the next morning with shrapnel in his stomach and begins his epic journey of survival. Using his super-genius mind, he manages to solve any problem thrown his way (and there were plenty). In the meantime, NASA, after announcing Watney's death, find out that he is still alive and do everything within their power to get him back. Everybody in the movie, from NASA to the crew to Watney, as Watney says, ""science the shit out of it.""
    Watney's first and arguably most important breakthrough was growing potatoes using a combination of astronaut poop, martian soil, and self-manufactured water. As the first human to grow anything on Mars, Mark technically colonized Mars. He proceeds to find an ingenious method to communicate with Houston which gives him encouragement to begin formulating a plan to get himself home. An incredible team effort from JPL, NASA, and the Ares 3 crew make Watney's return possible.
    So many times in movies, science is used as a shackle, an antagonist-- something that prevents heroic characters from doing their heroic things. It was refreshing to watch a mainstream sci-fi film that featured science and portrayed it in a positive light. Science is what allowed Watney to survive and thrive. Science was the hero. The key to this unique portrayal of science was that the science wasn't boring. It was pragmatic and fascinating to watch. And there was a healthy amount of humor to prevent Watney, NASA, JPL, and the crew from seeming like their stereotypes. The characters were approachable and made me want to team up with them to solve the problems that they were facing. The movie did a good job staying away from making the incredibly smart characters seem like elitists. The attitude of the movie encourages science and critical thinking which are skills becoming increasingly valuable in society today. In the Martian, Matt Damon was a great actor but science was the star.

4.5,"The Martian is a 2015 sci - fi adventure based on the book of the same name, by Andy Weir. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and based on the adapted screenplay by Drew Goddard.

Set in 2035, Mark Witney (Matt Damon) is a botanist conducting research on Mars as part of the Ares III research mission. The team conducting the mission is led by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and includes a number of team members that include Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena and Aksel Hennie.

The mission quickly sees the emergency evacuation of the planet as a heavy storm approaches and during the evacuation, Witney is injured and believed dead. The team complete the evacuation and begin the 10 month journey back to Earth.

However, Witney wakes to find himself the only person on the entire planet, with no means of contacting Nasa and a very limited food supply.

The film effectively operates in two parallel story lines. The first, a solo performance by Damon as he struggles to exist on the planet in a ruthless environment, the second an ensemble performance as the team at NASA slowly discover Witney remains alive and attempt to develop a plan whilst the rest of the team return home.

The team at NASA include Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, and Kristen Wiig.

The performance by Damon is outstanding in this film who effectively spends the entire film by himself. Usage of the station's video log creates the means that Damon voices his thoughts and plans and it is partly through this that he delivers his performance.

The setting of the film is done perfectly and it feels entirely real that you are watching scenes playing out on Mars itself. Additionally the soundtrack featuring some classic disco songs offers enjoyable light relief through the film.

The film offers a huge advertisement for science, and its hard to look at potatoes in the same way after the work that Damon goes through attempting to grow food on the planet.

The film is a huge success and rightly saw a number of nominations in the oscars. Damon's performance alone warrants the viewing but the storyline and broader performances also deliver high results. I loved it.

3.0,"In 2035, the crew of the Ares III manned mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. An unexpectedly strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to hastily leave the planet. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and lost in the storm; the last telemetry from his suit indicates no signs of life. With Watney believed dead, and the storm worsening by the second, mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) orders the remaining crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel Hermes without him. Watney awakens after the storm to a low oxygen warning, in pain, and makes his way to the ""Hab"" (hypocoristic for ""habitat""), the crew's base of operations. He removes a piece of antenna from his suit's biomonitor-which caused the erroneous life-sign readings-which has lodged in his torso, forcing him to perform self-surgery. He begins a video diary and realizes that his only chance of rescue is the arrival of the Ares IV crew at the Schiaparelli crater, 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) away, in four years. Calculating that he has enough food to last only 300 sols (roughly 309 days), Watney, a botanist, improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with human waste, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes saved for a Thanksgiving meal. He begins to modify the only functional rover to make long journeys across Mars to reach the rescue spot. Eventually he finds a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return...

The Martian received positive reviews, with critics commending the visual effects, musical score, scientific accuracy, writing, dialogue and the film's likeability, largely due to Matt Damon's performance. Variety reported, ""Critics are calling the film a funny, thrilling ride, and a return to form for [Ridley] Scott after The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings fell flat."" According to Robert Zubrin, commenting in The Guardian, ""[the film] is the first genuine Mars movie. It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot 'em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no monsters, no magic, no Nazis. However, there are a number of technical mistakes."" Writing for the New York Post, Lou Lumenick considered the film to be Scott's and Damon's best and thought that it is a ""straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar.""  Manohla Dargis, of The New York Times, stated that the film, ""involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he's physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free"", from a film director, whose ""great, persistent theme is what it means to be human"". Negative reviews focused on the lack of character depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, ""It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It hardly seems interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey."" In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors ""are treated as accessories"", and that the director is ""workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian - that's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?"" In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: ""Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott's two masterpieces - Alien and Blade Runner - it's not even on the same continent.""

""The Martian"" is a visually and effect wise nice sci-fi adventure about survival and exploration of deep space. It has a standard castaway plot, but what could´ve have been more dramatic and emotional ends up as a predictable and pretentious flag waving space story with a Matt Damon on autopilot and a too thin characterisation in general. Everything feels so convenient, politically correct and from A-Z in how everything develops to Watney´s advantage despite some bumps in the road. Ridley Scott used to own this genre, but has become so formulaic and boring in his direction and chosen projects these days. There´s no sparks at all from the magic Scott used to present in films like ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". The issue here is as well Damon who has a certain range as an actor, but never comes beyond a specific point that would take him further as an actor. ""The Martian"" is just a disappointment on many levels in my opinion and Scott fails to handle a range of serious psychological issues and scientific aspects about space which would´ve given us a better film most likely.

The Martian starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Jeff Daniels; brings a thrilling adventure almost as if you were there every step of Matt Damon's journey on Mars. Mark Watney (Damon) is an astronaut voyaging on Mars with his colleagues when suddenly the voyage takes a turn for the worst and leaves Mark left behind on Mars all alone believed to be dead. However to much surprise Mark is in fact alive, now he must survive  in solitude while trying desperately to return back to Earth. Mark becomes a ""martian"" surviving by farming on mars, and takes Mars by the rains while he awaits for his trip back to Earth, it's a long crazy thrilling ride as Mark does the impossible. The movie captures Damon's renowned acting ability while providing some comedic relief, with an excellent cast to provide the movie with everything it doesn't already have really completing the movie. However because of the small size of the cast at some points in the movie you might feel almost alone since the majority of the movie focuses on one man all one. While very interesting there's almost no variety in the setting with very little change, not to mention that almost every scene not on mars is very similar adding to the blandness of the movie.

===================
--Script/Direction: B+
There are several (mildly) amusing moments. I think this film would have sucked in the hands of a lesser director, but space films are old hat to Ridley Scott by now and he does a good enough job with the pacing such that it does not become (too) boring.
--Cast/Acting: B+
I feel compelled to compare this to last year's INTERSTELLAR, a somewhat similar film, and I must say Mat Damon's astronaut protagonist is infinitely more watchable than Mathew McWhatever's astronaut protagonist. Plus point: this film also stars the loveable Michael Pena in a supporting role.
--Production/Effects: B+
Some nice rolling shots of the Martian vista, which are inevitably marred by the thought that, ""whatever, we all know that ain't real Mars."" Nevertheless the space vehicles/space stations/outer space shots still look pretty convincing to the layman's eye.
--Bonus/Bias: +5%

4.5,"Feet On the Ground

Finally, a decent, character driven sic-fi, and from the least likely source - Ridley Scott. The Martian works because of the story derived from the novel and a natural, down to earth performance by Matt Damon. 

The story is Robinson Crusoe updated and is none the worse for it. Abandoned on Mars, our hero is a botanist, and so resourceful, he does more than survive the improbable time it takes to rescue him. It is well paced and shot with flair, but no bombast, easily one of Scott's best films.

It carries a decidedly modern, PC message. The white male hero is saved by women, blacks, orientals, Mexicans, etc - an anti-Trump undertone throughout. Two bizarre casting choices by Brit Scott of two of his fellows, Sean Bean and the impossibly named one from 10 Years a Slave. Neither adds a thing to this movie.

1.5,"It is a story theme I have seen many times before under various premises complete with the heroic last minute rescue. The overall plot reminded me of old Lost In Space episodes where the crew gets in some hopeless situation and clever little Will saves the day with some outlandish and risky solution. 

The movie is predictable, overacted, full of corn ball cliches and completely far fetched for non fantasy(attempts to be realistic) based science fiction. For example, our lead is able to find a probe from a failed mission sent many years earlier, dig it up and it works just fine? How was a ready to launch rocket placed my NASA for a future mission with no debris around it and why wouldn't a storm knock it over like it almost did to the current mission's rocket when the crew escaped at the beginning? I could go on and on.

I was not even wowed by the special effects and found them inferior to ""2001 a Space Odyssey""(I mention this film because comparisons where made) which was made decades ago with far less technology.

On top of all that it was just tedious and I had to force myself to watch to the all too predictable ending.

4.0,"When a fierce storm on Mars cuts off astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) from his colleagues, they fear the worst. Their commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR), has to make a critical decision. Blast off, leaving Watney behind, or stay and risk the lives of all the crew. She chooses to leave, not knowing that Watney is still alive. For Watney, his options are clear. Another mission to the Red Planet isn't expected for four years and he has enough food to last for 50 days. He needs to ""science the shit"" out of everything to stay alive until help can come.

THE MARTIAN is director Ridley Scott's (EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS) latest masterpiece... and it is a masterpiece. Sometime, hopefully in the near future, a few brave/lucky/crazy men and women will travel 140 million miles to Mars. For the rest of us, this film is the closest we're going to get. But for 134 minutes, we're right there with Watney and the team from NASA, through every success and failure (and there are plenty of both) as they push themselves to find creative solutions that will keep Watney alive and bring him home.

Thankfully, this is not a story about American patriotism or even American ingenuity. It's a story of perseverance, having a can-do attitude, cooperation and, most of all, how science can be sexy. There, I said it. Sexy science. (Who knew? To tell you the truth, I did. Just like Watney, I also majored in Botany in undergrad.) I have no doubt that NASA and other space agencies around the world will receive a flood of applications to their astronaut training programs in the coming months, but if it just means that more kids will want to study science in school, I'll be satisfied.

By now, the backstory of this story is legendary. Author Andy Weir, a computer programmer and himself the son of a particle physicist father and an electrical engineer mother, first put the book on his website in 2011 where he serialised it for free one chapter at a time. At the request of his fans, he then self-published it through Amazon, pricing it at just 99 cents, which is the minimum price allowed. The Kindle edition quickly sold 35,000 copies, garnering the attention of a number of publishers who had previously rejected his manuscript. In 2013, he sold the print rights to Crown Publishing Group for just US$100,000. (I hope he got a lot more than that for the movie rights.)

The book was adapted into a screenplay for the film by Drew Goddard, who started his career as a staff writer on the TV series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and its spinoff, ANGEL. He later penned the screenplay for the 2008 film, CLOVERFIELD, and shared co-writing duties on the 2013 film, WORLD WAR Z, which starred Brad Pitt.

This is Matt Damon's best work in years. He plays Watney as a guy who is both nerdy and cool at the same time. We cheer for him because he's Mr. Spock with a sense of humour and humanity. Many critics have made comparisons between Watney and Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks' character in the film, CAST AWAY). More than that though, are the similarities between Watney's GoPro camera (itself a star of the film) and Noland's volleyball, Wilson. In THE MARTIAN, we travel along with Watney on his journey as he documents both his work and his mood to the video camera. It's a much better narration device than having dead silence or watching the guy mutter to himself as he goes about his activities.

The film's supporting cast of Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig and others all bring ""the right stuff"" to the film as well, making it a real delight to watch (much like the cast of APOLLO 13 did with that film). Entertainment Weekly, in its review of the book in 2014, was less than impressed with Weir's treatment of these secondary characters. Not having read the book, I don't know if EW was just being harsh or if the characters were more fleshed out for the movie.

Although I thought it was an excellent film, I did have a couple of nits that needed picking. For me, the planet wasn't forbidding enough. The sky wasn't red (or butterscotch) enough, the temperature wasn't cold enough (temps there apparently average minus 63 degrees C), and the gravity wasn't weak enough (62 percent that of Earth, apparently). I was expecting Mark to bounce around a bit as he was walking, which didn't happen at all. I also had a problem with the Chinese space agency coming to NASA's rescue. I understand that this wasn't changed from the original but, to me, it seemed like a nice way to get Chinese government approval of the film and more box office revenue. (Perhaps Andy Weir was thinking down the road when he wrote the novel.)

4.0,"Ridley Scott seems to know what he is doing.  He manages to guide this blockbuster on its safe journey, hitting all the necessary highs and lows and with the requisite smart-ass dialogue in tow.  In many ways, this story of an astronaut left behind on Mars (not a spoiler since this happens in the first 10 minutes) feels like a true story - but of course it's not (and one wonders if NASA will ever get to attempt anything like manned voyages to Mars, given present and future budget problems).  Still it works as a faux replay of a story that we know will end well - it is just the process of getting to that happy ending that we need to watch.  Scott, aided immensely by Matt Damon (playing his usual average Joe), keeps the plot moving for more than two hours with intermittent crises and successes.  The rest of the cast play as a collective, trying to rescue him.  You can feel the problem-solving happening.  All the pieces fit together.

He manages to ""science the shit"" out of his situation and survive on left-behind rations and locally grown vegetables. He scavenges communications gear and contacts Earth. NASA has to decide what to do with the marooned astronaut, taking into account technical resources, orbital mechanics, and public relations.

From what I can tell, the science is pretty good in this, although I've read the violent sandstorm that starts this modern-day Robinson Crusoe tale is physically impossible in the thin Martian atmosphere Watney's ingenuity and technical skills are impressive, but perhaps not completely unrealistic for a cross-trained botanist.

5.0,"During a space exploration to Mars, a powerful storm forces the crew of astronauts to evacuate early. In their rush to leave, they lose track one of their crew members; they believe him to be dead. Against the odds, he lives, but he now finds himself alone stranded on the red planet. He knows it will take at least four years for a rescue mission to reach him, and that he has limited air and food supply. It inspires and thrills with a realistic feel, but at its core, it is extremely personal. Matt Damon is excellent. For much of the movie, he is alone talking to into the camera, speaking to himself while working, or using only physical expressions to covey his thoughts and feelings. The character does not wallow in self-pity. He knows he must channel his energy into surviving; that gives the movie a more optimistic perspective. The movie celebrates his triumphs, shows his sarcasm and humor that keep him going. There are still moments of sadness, fear, and defeat, but the main character is admiringly resilient. Damon conveys this range very well, and director Ridley Scott captures it all perfectly. The stark but beautiful rendering of the Martian landscape is powerful. It expresses the still loneliness and insignificance that the main character is feeling. While Matt Damon is superb, there is a strong supporting cast too. Characters on earth argue and debate how to handle the situation. This advances the plot and creates an interesting the subplot where the entire NASA organization works together to rescue their man. The events on earth also give important tonal breaks from the stillness of the Mars setting and make the move more exciting. There is part of you that knows things will work out, but this movie is more about how the lone astronaut survives and how some of the smartest people on earth plan the rescue mission. How they accomplish the impossible is completely fascinating in itself. Everything works exquisitely here with the story, characters, acting, direction, use of music, and visuals.

5.0,"Matt Damon portrays Watney with seamless ease, his dialogue seeming to be effortlessly dictated by Damon's own whims. Watney has an appealing sort of magnetism driven by his off-handed humorous pondering, his ingenuity, and his optimistic tenacity to survive. With no one for company and no entertainment except the music and TV shows that the crew left behind on their laptops, Watney keeps video logs to discuss his plans, his efforts, his failures, and his opinion of disco music. These video logs work as an excellent narrative and comedic device, providing both explanation for Watney's ideas and action, as well as giving some buoyancy to the peril of Watney's situation.

5.0,"If there was an ever movie for which I was happy for my nice, tidy wrap up, it was this movie!   Even though I was already familiar with the plot and aware of the ending, I don't believe I exhaled fully until the very last scene of the movie!  Watney was definitely hope and resilience personified, wasn't he?  It was uplifting to witness the perspective of Matt Damon's character manifested in the way he tackled his situation and circumstances; he made a choice to embrace one of my most favorite quotes that resonated so profoundly when I first heard it uttered by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne in _Shawshank Redemption_, ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" 
 
There is wonderfully exhilarating twist in the movie that reminded me of one of my favorite Bible verses that I kept formulating in my mind during scenes of the NASA collective working feverishly to bring Watney home safely and crowds congregating in front of jumbo screens, praying for a successful outcome was Matthew 18:20, ""For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them""... 
 
I thought it was awesome to see Jessica Chastain in another sci-fi movie as I instantly recognized her as Murphy from _Interstellar_; not until after the movie did I remember that Matt Damon was also in the same movie playing the more manic character, which was completely different from the more stable and pragmatic character he portrayed in this current movie! 

Of note, I was so impressed with the director for casting Donald Glover in the pivotal role of Rich Purnell, portrayed in a positive light when we are all too often bombarded with negative images of young African-American males in the media...                                          

Surprisingly, the film score was not as ethereally majestic as I had expected it would be as I imagined it would be as captivating as that of _Gravity_ and _Interstellar_; however, I still plan to purchase the movie when it becomes available on DVD and immerse myself in the minutiae as I usually do during encore viewings of movies I am compelled to watch again...",Lynn H,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jul 30, 2016",Lynn H,/user/id/952634753,RT,952634753,,The Martian

3.0,"With somewhat of a renaissance in space-themed cinema of late, 'The Martian' is one of the most high-profile efforts to garner accolades from critics and audiences alike. While it is kind of a mixture of many different genres - from drama to comedy and action-adventure - 'Martian' is really all about its main star, Matt Damon.

At the outset of the film, we see how an unexpected incident on a planet that is millions of miles away can lead to a series of events that unites the entire globe. The majority of the film centers around the actions Damon's character (Mark Watney) takes to stay alive as the only living organism on Mars. While Earth scrambles to rescue him - not an easy feat, considering the distance - we get to see how Watney solves various problems and overcomes challenges ranging from growing crops on Mars to human error. There are plenty of things that happen over the course of the film that hold viewers' attention, and there is plenty of entertainment value delivered.

While 'Martian' is basically ""The Matt Damon Show,"" the rest of the all-star cast delivers for the most part, as well. From Jessica Chastain as the commander of the NASA spacecraft Hermes to fellow NASA team members portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, there are plenty of good performances to go around (although it's odd seeing Kristen Wiig in a somewhat serious role). Still, none of them can compete with the screen time given to Damon. And while there are some scenes that make viewers say ""Really?"", all is pretty much forgiven considering it's Hollywood, after all.

The Martian

Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stuck on Mars! After Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) ordered Martinez (Michael Pena), Johansson (Kate Mara in her most fantastic 2015 sci-fi role), Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Vogel (Aksel Hennie) to leave him after his suit was perforated in a storm, Watney wakes up, and just makes it to the habitat, where he repairs the suit, and makes his first video log. Rather than give up like the less prepared and less skilled would, Watney defies the statement of NASA director Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and sciences the $h1+ out of Mars in a realistic manner. I do not feel like we should define this as science fiction, because it is fiction by the loosest definition: a story that has not happened in our world. It is a scientifically accurate fictional story. The length may seem overwhelming at first (almost two and a half hours), but they make the pacing work out, as well as have it make sense, both scientifically and storywise. We alternate between Watney, NASA, and more towards the end, the crew of Ares III. Mars is bright in the picture, because wherever they filmed this, you feel like it could really be Mars, and the establishing shots of the planets look amazing. I could believe they launched a camera into space to take those shots (Based on their budget, not too likely), and their use of CGI is minimal, which helped make it feel more like a movie based on a true story than a movie based on a fictional book. However, it is so plausible in terms of science and the humanity; they bring up the larger parts, but this is ultimately a story of survival and human compassion. All of this goes well with Harry Gregson-Williams' compelling soundtrack that hits all the right beats except the hilarious ones. That's right, for comic relief, we get Watney's lighter moments post-abandonment set to 70s music assumably from Lewis' collection she got to bring with her. His reaction to her taste (if you can call it that according to Watney) and the use of said songs at the right moments make for laughter to keep us from falling asleep and/or providing lighter moments. There's a bit more swearing though, especially for a PG-13 movie, but I'm not complaining, because the scenario called for it, and the character development was spot-on: we get to really care for Mark Watney, because we get to experience his sense of humor and see how the crew feels about abandoning him, and see how people really do have an inherent need to save each other, even if it's just one person, from lost hikers to abandoned astronauts on distant planets.

Martian brings in a bit of a twist by allowing home base, Houston, to become part of the show or solution. This is one aspect of the movie I enjoyed.

The tone of this movie is the only thing I can compare to Matt Damon's portrayal of this character. Both were light and witty, while maintaining suspense (as well as being realistically dramatic) and both made the film a joy to watch.

5.0,"The Martian was so great! I loved every minute of it! Let me explain what I loved.

Positives:
1. The characters; this film has a humongous cast so I'm going to list the stand outs, well for me anyway. Matt Damon was mesmerizing in this movie. He was entertaining, he added a lot of humanity to his character and when there are scenes where he is sad as well as going through some difficult situations, you feel it. Chiwetel Ejiofor was awesome! He is very likable and you are on his side when he tries desperately to get Mark Watney off Mars. Jeff Daniels was great as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone did a great job!

2. The tone; this film is pretty funny actually. The jokes are well written and it helps to keep you enlightened. But then there are times where things go down and its very intense and heartfelt, this film manages to balance both tones very well. This film had a danger of being too sappy but they nailed the tone well!

3. The visuals; this film is shot very well. The scenes at Mars are breathtaking as well as kind of scary too because of what Mark Watney is going through. The CGI is handled well, even though it is kind of obvious that it is CGI however the film had me invested so much that I didn't care.

Overall:
The Martian is absolutely awesome! Ridley Scott directed this film very well, Matt Damon pulls off one of his best performances in years and if you haven't seen The Martian, you definitely need to check it out.

4.5,"The inhospitable surface of Mars is a stunning backdrop for Ridley Scott's newest outing, The Martian; Scott has distinguished himself as a strong contributor to science fiction and he does it again here with what can easily be considered one of his best films.

Based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir, The Martian follows the NASA crew of Ares III as they carry out a mission on Mars; but when a raging dust storm compromises the mission, Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left behind in the confusion. Wasting no time with exposition or side plots, The Martian flings the viewer straight into the action which cuts between Watney's survival on Mars and NASA's efforts to ""bring him home"" as the tagline states. The most surprising thing about The Martian though is that it's a very light hearted movie; if you were expecting a bleak and serious struggle for survival along the lines of Cast Away then you'll be just as pleasantly surprised as I was. There's a great variety of humour mixed into just about every aspect of the film which strikes a stark contrast against the difficulty of Watley's predicament. A great sense of progression over the film's runtime is also present as plans come to fruition and Watley makes further progress in his efforts to stay alive. When NASA, the Ares III crew and other organisations all come together, it's incredibly gratifying and the film's final moments are laced with an uplifting and hopeful tone.

The characters that comprise The Martian are relatively straightforward and simple, but they interact with each other in a very natural way, something which hasn't really been seen in Ridley Scott's science fiction films since the 1979 film Alien. At the centre is Matt Damon, who turns in a very likeable and charismatic performance as Mark Watney; as the film goes on, his constant narrations and quips draw the audience in, cluing them in to the scientific undertones while keeping the plot moving at a steady pace. The side characters; comprised of the NASA employees on Earth and the crew of the Aeres are equally well defined. Jessica Chastain strikes a particularly good balance between her authority as the mission commander and responsibility for her fellow crew mates. The likes of Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofer and Sean Bean are also very convincing in their portrayals of Teddy Sanders, Vincent Kapoor and Mitch Henderson respectively. The characters of The Martian ultimately feel real, and that's a more effective tool to make the audience root for them than any other.

To make its special effects more authentic and engaging, The Martian features input and contributions from NASA and it really shows; the film boasts one of the most fully featured and realised portrayals of space travel yet seen in a modern science fiction. The way the Aeres III crew operates, not to mention the methods Watley uses to produce food and stay alive seem quite plausible, creating a sense of wonder in the audience. There really isn't a single area of the film which is lacking in terms of visuals, from the cinematography to the use of on-set filming. Wadi Rum in Jordan was used to replicate the surface of Mars and it looks incredibly believable; this is aided by the sweeping camerawork where we look across the vast and beautiful landscapes. The Martian also makes use of a varied and fitting soundtrack, with serene background tracks placed against classic disco tunes which adds to the light-hearted tone. Rounding off the package is a collection of special effects for the scenes in outer space and these boast an enormous sense of scale that can stand alongside the likes of other films in the genre such as Gravity and Interstellar.

All in all, The Martian comes together brilliantly; its refreshingly light-hearted tone, relatable characters and top notch effects make it one of the best films of the year and a solid return to form for Ridley Scott. With luck, the director will have more strong sci-fi stories in store for us for the foreseeable future.",Rob C,False,False,False,False,4.5,"May 21, 2016",Rob C,/user/id/919255946,RT,919255946,,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is a fantastic movie and was one of my favorite movies of 2015. Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, an astronaut who is left stranded on Mars after mistakenly left for dead. Astronaut Watney has to use his wits and his science know-how to survive on Mars long enough so that NASA can rescue him. Damon brought a lot of charm and charisma into the role, making the character extremely likable. The movie is also has a lot of levity. Everyone working in the film does a great job, from the director, the actors, cinematographer, and SFX crew. Mars looks absolutely stunning. The movie doesn't have any force conflict between characters and any character with opposing thoughts has perfectly good explanation for them. It's a breath of fresh air for a film to not have an antagonist if you exclude bad luck itself.  The movie's main theme of people coming together to work through problems in order to achieve a goal is displayed very well.

It's pretty good. The hokey exposition of Mark Watney talking to himself is tempered by Damon's self-deprecating tone. The action sequences are suspenseful and devastating, and Watney's agricultural, geographical, and semiotic ingenuity is ingenious. Damon gives an emotional turn, especially when he performs surgery on himself and right before the final launch when he finally lets himself cry and feel the last-ditch enormity of the moment.

4.0,"""The Martian"" is both a thrilling and hilarious Sci-Fi movie of 2015. The plot to ""The Martian"" is that a group of scientists are sent to ""Mars"" to study it. While they are there a strong storm hits and ""Mark Watney"" portrayed by ""Matt Damon"" is in the middle of the storm. The crew leaves ""Mars"" thinking that ""Watney"" died in the storm but later they are all shocked to find out that he survived the storm. So ""N.A.S.A."" must do everything they can to bring ""Watney"" back to ""Earth"". The opening to the movie shows the crew on ""Mars"" doing their work. The scene is good but doesn't feel like an opening scene. For most of the movie it shows ""Watney"" trying to survive on ""Mars"". As well as this the movie also shows what ""N.A.S.A."" is doing on ""Earth"". The scenes with ""Watney"" adapting to his new habitat are very entertaining but the scenes of N.A.S.A. can sometimes be boring. The movie's climax is a very thrilling and suspenseful scene. The plot to the movie is superb; except for the N.A.S.A. scenes those are boring. ""Matt Damon"" gives the movie a stunning performance as ""Mark Watney""; he truly knows how to act. ""Harry Gregson-Williams"" composed a happy soundtrack for ""The Martian"", at times the music fits in with the scenes and other times it feels weird. Director ""Ridley Scott"" shoots scenes well to express the emotion of each character. If you are a person who enjoys Science Fiction movies then I highly recommend you watch ""The Martian"" as it has amazing acting, a great plot and is a well-shot movie. Although the movie does have some issues these being some better music, some less boring scenes and a better opening scene.

Even more noteworthy than its daring zero gravity finale is the movie's tone, which strikes a cheery contrast to Scott's usual ominous routine.

3.5,"Matt Damon seems to have a sideline is movies that require him to be rescued by others, Saving Private Ryan, Interstellar and now The Martian!
This was a very decent adaptation of the novel by Andy Weir and although it maybe sacrilege to say this, it is also a lot more accessible than the novel.  Despite it's merits I have to say the book did rely on a lot of technical and scientific language at which point I found myself switching off whereas here all of the science is still there but it's given a visual representation.
I thought Matt Damon did a decent job of carrying the movie on his shoulders, there are scenes on Earth and on the space shuttle but most of the movie is Damon alone on a desolate planet trying to figure out how he can survive until he gets rescued.  It sounds grim but there is plenty of humour alongside the tension in the movie too.

4.0,"It's everything you'd expect from a Hollywood Blockbuster and that's great but it doesn't really have an edge. The premise is enough to keep it engaging but as all of the boxes are ticked as the movie progresses, I found myelf wishing it had been just a little more interesting. 

It's a good space movie and thanks to some laughs, as well as its wacky but not TOO wacky premise, 'The Martian' manages to be more than just another generic entry into the genre. With that being said, however, there are no surprises with this one- we all know what's going to happen and so it's really a case of a dull film being made into a solid one. 

I would have loved to see 'The Martian' embrace its scientific elements more and really play about with the day to day realities of trying to survive on Mars. Instead, the science covered certainly helped the film but it felt a bit surface level. if this was a time travel movie, it'd be closer to Back to the Future than to Primer. There's certainly nothing wrong with that but I'd just love a space film to really drive home the point that space is hard, like really hard, and I don't think that's happened yet. Instead, the big hitters tend to get caught up in the human aspect and the isolation of space. I love that too but, let's be honest, 'The Martian' isn't going to beat Movies like 'Gravity' at that game. 

When all is said and done then, 'The Martian' is a solid addition to Ridley Scott's repertoire but it's not groundbreaking and it will never become iconic- it's no 'Alien' or 'Blade Runner', that's for sure.",Allen G,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Apr 24, 2016",Allen G,/user/id/945668697,RT,945668697,,The Martian
3.5,"Super-science is the name of the game in this drama regarding a Botanist who was left behind during a super storm on planet Mars in 2035. Astronaught Mark Watney wakes up after the dust settles and finds himself abandoned by the Aries III crew with no means of communication, a decreasing supply of food and water, and the harsh environment of the Mars surface on the outside of his surface pod. Watney drums up the courage to continue surviving despite bodily injury, starvation, dehydration, and several near death experiences.

The scope and scale of this movie is pretty amazing. So much so that it inspired one of those ""War of the Worlds"" moments in modern society. Several articles were published in American newspapers about movie goers who either believed they were watching a dramatization of real events or a documentary. Yes, some people actually believed we went to Mars because of this film, but that isn't the impressive part.

What i really enjoyed about this movie wasn't the acting to be honest. I really didn't find any moment where I felt Watney to be in any real danger, and you somehow always know he'll be okay. His confidence brings him a long way through this sci-fi drama, and of course I'm no scientist so it's hard to refute any of his survival techniques (seriously though... a plastic door and some duct tape?). Never the less, the thing that is by far the most outstanding achievement of this film, is the use of real organizations, technologies, and creating an amazing setting on the surface of mars. I couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked, and was constantly impressed with the effort this director took to make it somewhat believable. Enough to fool a few anyway.

An excellent weekend movie, and be prepared for a lot of Matt Damon screen time. But that's to be expected in a movie that features and actor that has been rescued more times than a cat from a tree.

4.0,"My review will be of the movie ""The Martian"" starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott.  In this review I will be discussing story, characters and acting, and adapted material.  Spoiler alert by the way for any who have not seen the movie.
	First up is story, the story takes place a few years in the future where a manned exploration of mars has set up a camp on the surface of Mars.  The exploration team has been on the surface for around 20 days and is suddenly hit by a major sandstorm which forces them to get off planet.  Trying to escape to the nearby rocket lead actor Matt Damon is struck by a rogue piece of debris and is knocked away from the group and presumed dead.  Now from this point in the movie the action is split into two parts, half the story is on Mars with Damon trying to survive and the other half is NASA trying to find ways to rescue him.  The film does a very nice representation of hopelessness in space and of portraying real science when Damon is forced to deal with such problems like finding water or figuring out how to travel long distances.
	Second is the film's characters.  The main characters are Mark Watney played by Matt Damon, Chris Beck played by Sean Bean, and Venkat Kapoor played by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  The characters in this film play off each other very well as they try to help Mark get off Mars and are very in synch with each other, which is common with veteran actors.  As the movie goes on you get a very good connection with the characters and if you're anything like me, you get immersed hard in movies with greatly portrayed characters and genuinely care about their struggles and triumphs.  The acting is so greatly acted that I honestly couldn't find any faults with it except some 4th wall breaking but that was it, the actors really gave it their all in this movie.
	Most going into the movie would not know that the film is actually an adaptation of a book written by Andy Weir.  Now some say that books are better than the movies and that sometimes people say the movies are better than the books I.E. Lord of the ring, Harry potter, etc, etc, but to me the book and movie are on par with each other.  The movie is very well adapted and includes a lot of explanation and scenes from the book that would otherwise be left out if directed by anyone else.  Unfortunately not everything could be adapted and probably that was for the best, because in the book the author gets deep into real mathematics that would not be interesting to a movie going audience.  I have to give it to Ridley for doing an incredible job in adapting the book into a insanely good movie.
	So all in all this review painted the movie in a very good light and for others they may agree, but some might have seen some flaws that I didn't pick up on and so on and so forth.  But as a movie goer who enjoys great films I highly recommend this so any and all willing to give it a chance.",Bob B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Apr 19, 2016",Bob B,/user/id/974143126,RT,974143126,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/136850690050169/picture,The Martian

5.0,"After a few duds, Ridley Scott is right back on form with this brilliant hard science fiction movie. There's no ray guns or aliens but there is plenty of conceivable, well thought out scientific ideas as Mat Damon struggles to stay alive on the Red Planet after his crew mates are forced to leave him behind following an accident. Damon gives one of his best performances as the straight talking botanist who is forced to utilise his skills and knowledge to the full when faced with ridiculous odds of survival. The story is told effectively and simply and, to be honest, there are few elements that are surprising. What elevates this film beyond the normal survival against the odds tale is the conviction of Damon and the likability of his character. He comes over as a normal guy who just worked hard to get where his is and believes utterly in what he is doing. In fact, the rest of the cast are equally well suited to their respective roles. In particular, I liked Jeff Daniels as the business-like and slightly spiky head of NASA, Teddy Sanders. Naturally in such a film, there are plenty of effects but these are never overwhelming and the attention is always on the human story.

Matt Damon is great as Mark Watney, a great character with a fabulous voice in the novel (which he narrates in the first person), and the film retains most of his personality. The science that is embedded in almost every page of the novel isn't skimped on either; this is an intelligent and witty and tense thriller.

Most of the playtime is slow preparations for savement seen from both Mars and the earth. It looks crisp, clean and nice. All right acting and a nice character knowledge are developed. It's like I have seen the film before. It's close to many big sci-fi movies lately. It's hard to believe much here, things seem impossible all the time and that's a big flaw here.

By another treaty if you're not in any country's territory, maritime law aplies. So Mars is international waters. Now, NASA is an American non-military organization, it owns the Hab. But the second I walk outside I'm in international waters. So Here's the cool part. I'm about to leave for the Schiaparelli Crater where I'm going to commandeer the Ares IV lander.

So I'm going to be taking a craft over in international waters without permission, which by definition... makes me a pirate. Mark Watney: Space Pirate.

While Matt Damon was stellar as Mark Watney, the rest of the cast also deserves a large amount of praise, and I'm going to try and remember all their names (Glover, Wiig, Mara, Stan, Daniels, if I'm missing anybody I'm sorry). Whoever casted this movie deserves a large raise. Additionally, the movie is very faithful to the book. All in all, this film is a great reflection of the human condition, the cast was amazing, especially Matt Damon, and the cinematography was stunning.

3.5,"Review:
Now that I have finally got to watch this movie, after listening to all of the hype and seeing loads of footage, I can actually say that it was quite enjoyable but I personally think that Moon was better. I've tried to watch Gravity again but I get bored after the first few minutes, and I've got a funny feeling that, that might happen if I try and watch this movie again. That doesn't mean that it's a bad film, because I did feel the tension throughout the movie but for some unknown reason, I can't see myself sitting down for 2 and a half hours, watching a film were I know what happens at the end. There isn't any outstanding performances, like Sam Rockwell in Moon, and the storyline is very straight laced, until his potato stash becomes contaminated. The film does look great, and so it should with such a big budget, and the crew was a great variation of characters which brought different elements to the team but I still feel that it lacked a certain something, which would have made this film an all time classic. Matt Damon (Mark Watney), played his part well and he made his character feel real, especially when he used his scientific knowledge to stay alive but I still felt a bit empty when the movie finished. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, for a tension/drama point of view but I personally was expecting more. Watchable!Â 

Round-Up:
Is there anything that Matt Damon, 45, can't do! After his brief roles in Mystic Pizza and Field Of Dreams, during the 80's, he first came to light in Courage Under Fire in 1996 after starring in Glory Daze and School Ties alongside his close friend, Ben Affeck. He then played a lawyer with Danny Devito in the Rainmaker but his career really kicked off when he starred and wrote Good Will Hunting with Ben Affeck, and also won an Oscar for Best Writing. Since then, his career has gone from strength to strength and he has the ability to cover any and every genre with ease. The fact that he doesn't take himself to seriously and he treats people with respect, makes him a liked person in Hollywood, and with his return to the Bourne franchise and a movie about the Great Wall of China in the pipeline, proves that he's not one to be type-casted. Its amazing how a free book, from Andy Wear, which eventually went on Amazon for $0.99, became such a blockbusting success. Ridley Scott's amazing attention to detail, made him plant a real potato farm so the audience could see the different stages of growth. He also got detailed information from NASA which was also used in the film, so a lot of the scenes in the film, are not made up. Anyway, I think I would have appreciated the movie more, if I didn't see it so long after its release but with that aside, it's still a well made film which I found quite entertaining.

Budget: $108million
Worldwide Gross: $630million

4.0,"-The Martian is een 2015 Amerikaanse science fiction film, geregisseerd door Ridley Scott en in hoofdrol Matt Damon. De film is gebaseerd op Andy Weir's 2011 roman The Martian, welke Drew Goddard aangepast heeft in een scenario. Damon stert als een astronaut die per abuis doodgewaande en achtergelaten wordt op Mars. De film toont zijn strijd om te overleven en anderen' de inspanningen om hem te redden. De film's ensemble cast ook Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie en Chiwetel Ejiofor.

-De film ging in première op het 2015 Toronto International Film Festival op 11 september 2015. 20Th Century Fox heeft de film vrijgegeven in de bioscopen in de Verenigde Staten op 2 oktober 2015. De film werd uitgebracht in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D en 4DX. De film ontving lovende recensies en begrootte meer dan $626 miljoen wereldwijd, Scott's hoogste brutering film tot nu toe, evenals de tiende hoogste brutering film van 2015. Het ontving diverse onderscheidingen, waaronder de Golden Globe Award voor Beste Motion Picture - Musical of comedy en zeven Academy Award nominaties, waaronder die voor Beste Film en Beste aangepast scenario voor Goddard. Voor zijn prestaties, Damon werd bekroond met verschillende awards nominaties, waaronder de Academy Award voor beste acteur, de Bafta voor Beste acteur, de criticus's Choice Award voor beste acteur, en hij won de Golden Globe voor beste acteur in een musical of komedie.

--Ontvangst: 

-Kritische reactie: 

-The Martian ontving  kritische toejuiching toen het in première ging op het Toronto International Film Festival. De herziening aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, die categoriseert beoordelingen als positief of negatief, de ondervraagde 290 critici en vastgesteld dat 92% van de recensies waren positief met een gemiddelde score van 7,9 op 10 en de consensus ""Slimme, spannend en verrassend grappig, The Martian biedt een getrouwe adaptatie van de bestseller boek dat haalt het beste uit acteur Matt Damon en regisseur Ridley Scott."" De site merkte verder op dat critici opmerkten dat Scott ""onderzocht hoopvollere grondgebied"" dan in zijn vroegere films, en ""het resultaat is een ontzagwekkende avontuur die verkent uitgestrekte ideeën tijdens een verblijf in zeer menselijk emotioneel gebied."" Critici vonden de visuele effecten, de wetenschappelijke nauwkeurigheid, en de film houden van, grotendeels te wijten aan Matt Damon's optreden. Metacritic ondervraagde ook 46 critici en beoordeeld 40 beoordelingen als positief en zes gemengd, waarbij een totale score van 80 uit 100, waarin ""algemeen gunstige beoordelingen"".

-Variety meldde, ""Critici noemden de film een grappige, spannende rit en een terugkeer naar het formulier voor (Ridley) Scott na The Counselor en Exodus: Gods and Kings plat vielen.""

-The Martian werd uitgeroepen tot een van de beste films van 2015 met meer dan 50 critici en publicaties en eindigde op de zevende plaats op Rotten Tomatoes en dertiende op Metacritic's best beoordeelde film van 2015.

--Wetenschappelijke nauwkeurigheid: 

-Toen Andy Weir de roman schreef The Martian heeft hij zich beijverd om de wetenschap zo correct mogelijk te weergeven en gebruikte reader feedback om het zo te krijgen. Wanneer Ridley Scott begon aan de film, hij zocht ook om het zo  realistisch te krijgen met hulp van James L. Green, directeur van het Planetary Science Division bij NASA. Green stelde teams samen te beantwoorden aan wetenschappelijke vragen die Scott stelde. Green zei, ""The Martian is redelijk realistisch"", hoewel hij zei dat de films gevaarlijke stofstorm, ondanks het bereiken van een snelheid van 120 mijl per uur (190 km/h) zou in werkelijkheid een zwakke kernkracht hebben. Green vond ook de NASA gebouwen in de film stijlvoller zijn dan de functionele hedendaagse  die NASA daadwerkelijk gebruikt. Filmcritici pakte het punt op dat The Martian wind oplopen tot ""nauwelijks een licht briesje"" in hun beoordelingen en scenarist Drew Goddard overeengekomen de wind moest aanzienlijk worden overdreven om de situatie op te zetten waarin het verhaal in beweging zet.

-Ed Finn, directeur van het Centrum voor wetenschap en de verbeelding van de Arizona State University, zegt ""Wat dit verhaal echt goed doet is een nabije toekomst scenario verbeelden dat niet te ver doordrukt van waar we nu staan technisch vandaag.""  Britse fysicus Brian Cox zei, ""The Martian is de beste reclame voor een carrière in de engineering.

3.5,"Entertaining but too safe. Matt Damon is stuck on Mars growing potatoes and listening to 70s disco music. There is no air of menace or a credible threat. This is not what lost in space movies should be about.

It looks great - the machinery and the Red Planet are particularly fetching - but the storyline is too bland. And the Nasa-based bosses soon exhaust their collection of grimaces and furrowed brows.

Damon is again on his A-game and carries the film well, but the rest of the cast are bit-players and the movie suffers because of it.

It needs more (bad pun alert) gravity. We want some serious danger or a deeper take on life. All we get is Damon shrugging off problems and smiling his way to his inevitable rescue.

4.5,"Truly a love letter to science as Ridley intended. The script gives a fantastic foundation that Ridley exploits to brilliant heights. The strongest aspect of the film is Mark Watney. He is a wonderfully intelligent botanist with a sense of humor that thrives talking to cameras that log every beat of his incredible survival. Once again another movie celebrates how human beings are gifted with a spirit and an ingenuity that can battle against the most extreme circumstances. The film is in its majority, very accurate and showcases how Watney is able to problem solve his way through nearly everything. I liked the choice to not focus just on him and bring in the team on Earth and in space. A talented cast captures the hope and hopelessness of bringing one man home. Above all, this film is life affirming. What NASA would go through to save one life. Every life is worth moving mountains to preserve. Wherever that life is, whatever its challenges or setbacks, you do all in your power to save it. A witty script, solid cast, and excellent pacing that blends science and drama is a winning combination and now I'm upset that the Martian was little recognized at the Oscars.

2.5,"The Martian is a bluntly well-rounded, decidedly safe, for ages 8 to 80 family-friendly filmic feature. This is a solid film of the copiously generic and the stridently mediocre where its non-existing suspense is only matched by its departed drama. This film haplessly travels many mega miles in striving to stand out within cinema experience as a truly memorable survival story with a strong and intriguing scientific encasing only to irrevocably stand out as a movie completely and wholly anathema to these intentions. 

By no means is this a dreadful movie nor is it farcical. The simple fact remains that The Martian is a simple movie with a good director - he's not simple but he used to be much better - and some semi-interesting plot hurdles that the stranded astronaut has to overcome. What needs to be duly stressed is the reality of this movie lacking many qualities that one would expect in a three-dimensional script slash plot even to the extent that the good qualities it expressly retains are not even praise-worthy themselves. Perhaps 'good qualities' should be singular. 

The directing, photography and cinematography are beyond average, thanks to Scott, but not so far beyond average that you need to write home to your mother about it even this far away from home. The story arc is also astronomically simple - is 'retarded' still politically incorrect? - with the plot's full effect being a mission to mars to save an astronaut. Usually effortless plots like these enmesh with high octane action sequences and high-pitched finger-pointing drama covered in beads of sweat to keep the viewer interested. Alas, don't expect this kind of ensemble. In fact don't expect any form of suspense, drama, survival edge, character development nor frisson. If The Martian was such a film I would have probably rated it much higher. This film is totally devoid of the aforementioned facets and with such an elementary plot trajectory coupled with often less-than-intellectual dialogue it is a wonder as to how this film gained such massive approval. Is it because fathers could finally watch a movie that their wives and children would also like as well? 

The strongest elements to this movie reside in the quasi-scientific dialogue and the survival-based science etched sporadically and sparingly through the film. I do see this as The Martian's strongest feature and one that I did enjoy throughout the main feature itself. It is just a shoddy shame that there was not more of it. Each scene of scientific observance and application is speedily solved and quickly dismissed with the plot hurdle at hand just so the film gets to the next plot hurdle so it can be just as quickly dismissed. The scientific journey is never dwelt upon nor is there a marination process for it to be easily digested for the viewer which is a sign of betrayal to the audience and in particular the science fan-boy. Brute, et tu? Also in-between each spike of scientific undertaking there is a lot of stock-standard space readying itself in vain for the next anti-climactic spike in scientific pursuit. This stock-standard space happens to be as vacuous as the atmosphere in which it is set in. How 'meta'.

The scientific flaws in the movie are apparently numerous and not well-disguised either. Yes, the strongest element to this movie has a further lethal flaw. Firstly, the atmosphere volume on Mars is about 1% that of Earth's so don't expect planetary storms strong enough to strand an astronaut - yes, having a stranded astronaut is one of the MAIN premises of the film. Secondly, Damon's character is a Botanist who can appropriate near endless mathematical formulas on physical and non-botanical levels, retrofit and interoperate complex mechanical systems and do anything else that is non-Botany-related to survive his watered-down ordeal. Thirdly, the Red Planet has 60% of the sunlight as on Earth and the plants that Damon's character was growing were further protected from the sunlight via the plastic greenhouse covering. There would not be enough photosynthesis for Damon to grow his plants. Also the soil on Mars is incredibly dense with Iron so growing life would be, again, near impossible. If that wasn't enough the NASA potatoes would not have been able to produce seedlings, to grow more potatoes, seeing as companies as basic as your local supermarket use sprout inhibitors to produce longevity for the potatoes. The whole point of potatoes in space is to feed its frontiersman and stay as fresh as possible. Sorry, you aren't going to grow potatoes from these modified potatoes. Fourthly, water was discovered on Mars weeks before the release of The Martian which would have made a massive overhaul to the plot if it was included. These flaws are not inlets for minor suspensions of disbelief nor are they scene-specific. These flaws fatally gnaw away at the premises and building blocks of this movie. This is a movie that prides itself on its supposed scientific pre-eminence. Pride before the fall it seems.

Scott's The Martian desperately seems to be just another coil in the downward spiral of what appears to be Scott's filmography these days. Matt Damon isn't safe either. Apparently he has been in eight movies where he has needed rescuing. Is this déjà vu from Interstellar as well? Maybe Ricky Gervais was right. The Martian might deservedly be a candidate for the prestigious 'Comedy of the Year' title whether intentional to the movie or not. It doesn't matter though; Matt Damon is still not my favourite Martian.

Recommended movies instead:

1. For sci-fi survival-based drama watch 'Gravity'.

2. For a true science fiction experience with good visuals, quasi-interesting dialogue and speckled drama as an all-round cinemadventure space epic watch 'Interstellar'.",Ben P,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Mar 06, 2016",Ben P,/user/id/786964860,RT,786964860,,The Martian

5.0,"Welcome back, Sir Ridley Scott. After a one-two punch of disappointments, the legendary director is back with what is one of his finest outings not just in recent memory, but in his entire career. The Martian just works, whether that's due to the beautiful visuals, the clever screenplay full of wry sarcastic humor, or the ensemble cast who give some of their best performances of their respective careers. Writer Drew Goddard nails the sense of humor of Andy Weir's novel, and proves why he's one of Hollywood's finest screenwriters. Perhaps the greatest achievement of The Martian's script, however, is ultimately how inspiring it is; between this and Interstellar, space adventure films that are sure to renew your interest in the great beyond are on a nice little streak. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as Mark Watney, delivering the aforementioned humor in a charming, charismatic matter that doesn't feel out of place. However, when the time calls for it, Damon succeeds equally in his more serious moments as well. The rest of the ensemble cast all give it their all too, and nobody does anything less than great. Ridley Scott is definitely capable of getting the best out of his cast, and this is no exception. Scott is also capable of creating a visual masterpiece, and The Martian, again, is no exception. The Mars landscape is stunning, and the numerous space shots are equally so. All of the other technical aspects are perfect as well. It's always nice to see a director step back into the spotlight after a misfire or two, and The Martian is the perfect piece for Ridley Scott to do just that .

3.5,"Damon carries his role as the astronaut abandoned on Mars with much conviction. The film itself keeps from straying too far in to grand spectacle and philosophical rendering, and focuses itself on the survival tale. And certainly Ridley Scott deserves recognition for turning what could have been a serious, tense and dire tale in to such a humorous romp.

It's not a masterpiece, which is worth noting given it's position as an oscar contender, nor is it necessarily a film that stands above in terms of relevance and importance.

3.5,"In Stanley Kubrick's epic space saga, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Strauss' ""Blue Danube Waltz"" plays over a famous docking sequence. In Ridley Scott's The Martian, a critical docking sequence is scored by David Bowie's ""Starman.""

The differences go on, but perhaps it's this one that best demonstrates what Scott is going for in relation to cinema's true space masterpiece. The Martian isn't and doesn't want to be transcendent, and that's fine. What isn't quite fine is the way it also pales in comparison to the similarly ""popcorny"" Gravity (emphasis on ""corny"" when it comes to The Martian). Alfonso Cuaron's film was relentless spectacle. The Martian breathes, and while those pauses help develop characters and laughs, they also distract us from what ought to be a harrowing experience. I liked The Martian for what it was, but I still couldn't help wish it was and wanted to be something more.

The film follows the triumphs and many tribulations of Mark Watney (Matt Damon). One of the six NASA astronauts who are part of the Ares III mission to Mars, Watney gets left behind when his crew presumes him dead and evacuates following a sudden storm. Without communications but still in possession of all the other equipment meant to keep him alive on Mars for a short time, Watney goes to work extending the life of his shelter (the HAB), water reclaimer, and oxygenator. The trickiest problem, though, is food. Without more, he'll starve in a few months. But Watney is a world-class botanist, and as he so eloquently states, he's ready to ""science the shit out of this.""

It's not long before NASA realizes that Mark is alive, and it's all hands on deck figuring out a way to bring him home. His crew, however, is in the dark. Few on Earth think it smart to let these five grieving men and women know their extent of their error, what with many months of complicated space travel in front of them. None of their challenges, nor the challenges of those on Earth, remotely compare to what Mark faces, however. Every time it seems like our beloved space pirate is thriving, he gets surprised-and nearly killed-by something terrible.

The best thing The Martian has going for it is the presence of Matt Damon. He gives the best movie star performance of the year as the stranded man with a sardonic wit. On paper (or e-readers, if that's your thing), Mark Watney comes across as pretty unrealistic and fairly inhuman. But on film, Damon gonna Damon. He's not Mark Watney; He's Matt Damon playing astronaut. And considering the sort of low artistic bar the film is trying to clear, a performance of this nature is exactly what it needs.

Visually, this film's Mars doesn't have a lot of character, but it's creatively shot and edited with lots first-person body-cam footage and narrated montages that help guide us through some of the text's more scientifically dense, ""tell don't show"" passages. Scott's musical choices add to the fun.

He balances all that with more suspense-driven scenes and serious-minded characters back on Earth. While Damon carries the film, the rest of the cast is aces, too. Chiwetel Ejifor and Jeff Daniels are high-level NASA directors charged with making billion-dollar, life-or-death decisions on behalf of a half-dozen individuals. Benedict Wong is the overworked team leader trying to get Watney food as quickly as possible. And Kristen Wiig is the paranoid NASA press liaison-arguably the worst job on planet Earth for the duration of his crisis.

On the Hermes, which slowly carries Watney's teammates home, it's a mix of the two competing attitudes. Jessica Chastain is their commander, who carries the weight of leaving Watney behind squarely on her shoulders. Meanwhile, it's not hard to see why Watney and Michael Pena's Martinez are best friends.

A lot has been said about both this film and its source material being a return to smart, character-driven science-fiction. It's definitely a surprisingly character-driven story, considering its title brings to mind little green goblins. But smart? A film can talk all it wants about soil properties and propulsion paths and whatever mumbo jumbo is getting spit out at us, but I'd argue The Martian is actually enjoyable because it's dumb. Its characters are resourceful, which is ultimately what allows the film to resonate, but those who enjoy The Martian the most are the viewers who go in ready to shut their brains off. They'll get taken on a wild, fantastical ride between worlds, while everyone else wonders how exactly the Rich Purnell maneuver makes any sense.

5.0,"Spectacular sets and the beautiful scenery make it nigh impossible to believe beyond obvious science that no filming on Mars had taken place at all. And those stunning backdrops of the red planet stretch far into the distance beyond a top performance by leading man Matt Damon, as astronaut and botanist Mark Watney, who provides us with light and perfectly-timed comedic moments that balance brilliantly against the moments of seriousness we see in his situation of being stranded alone on the desolate planet as he seeks a way to contact the people of Earth (made of an excellent supportive cast including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean and Kristen Wiig, who delivers a great performance in a more serious role than we would be used to seeing her take on), who all believe him to be dead, as well as do the rest of his team floating further away from him into space, led by Jessica Chastain (who, again amidst the same cast as Damon, brings another great performance in the genre so soon after previous year's Interstellar) whilst surviving on limited supplies. Throughout, the pace is flawless and filled with many memorable scenes up until the final shot, making the time in which you are seated feeling nowhere close to the 2 hours 14 minutes the film is listed to be, further making every shot worth every minute of your time, right up to a climax that left me with goosebumps, and an ending that left me wanting to watch it for the first time all over again, if not simply to see even more. The end result is definitive proof that Ridley Scott is still a master of science-fiction, even over three decades after releasing his classics Alien and Blade Runner, which helped make the genre so popular today.

4.5,"SPOILERS!!!
MacGyver en Marte, es lo que es Mark, El Personaje que Interpreta Matt Damon en la Película, Y se Convierte en mi Favorita para los Oscars y una de las Mejores del 2015...Y Prefiero ver esto a ver Interstellar.

Luego de una Expedición de la Nasa en Marte, todo resulta mal cuando una Tormenta de Arena se acerca, lo que obliga a la tripulación a abandonar el Planeta dejando atrás a Mark ya que es Golpeado por un Aparato y es dado por Muerto, Mark queda varado solo y sin ninguna Comunicación de la Tierra en Marte y tendrá que Sobrevivir, hacer de todo para seguir con vida, Comunicarse con la Tierra y salir del Planeta Rojo.

Hablemos de lo malo, Y es que como mencione es MacGyver, Damon puede hacer de todo, Desde darle vida a Plantas en Marte, O improvisar varias cosas como la Nave de donde salio de Marte O como reparar la Puerta de la Nave y eso puede llegar a ser algo muy irreal, Algunos Personajes se sienten muy Olvidados, que parecen que van a tener Relevancia pero luego de desaparecen, Y algunos Chistes que pueden ser muy Repetitivos como la Música Disco de los 70's

Lo bueno, Es que la Película ademas de llevar Mucho de Física logra como Explicarte todo Científicamente y Con Por Ejemplo ''Dibujos'' para que el Espectador logre entenderlo, no como interstellar que no Explica nada y te quedas en el Limbo, Las Actuaciones son muy buenas, Pero todo el Peso cae en Matt Damon.

la Película es Entretenida nunca te llega a Aburrir, Porque Ridley sabe como manejar eso y Matt aporta algo con sus Chistes.
Es una muy Buena Película de Ciencia Ficcion y creo que en mi Opinión en los Oscars esta solo por Debajo de Mad Max.

La Peli es basada en un Libro de 2011, Siente realmente la Tensión en muchas escenas como la del Rescate, o cuando trata de Tomar la Mano de Chastain Pero creo que el Peor Error de la Película es el Tiempo Cronológico porque hace ver que Pasaron Muchos Años pero luego dicen que solo fue un Año.

Prefiero ver muchas veces a The Martian y la Prefiero en todos los aspectos, a ver Interstellar, The Martian supera en todo al intento que hizo Nollan.

4.0,"cinegeek.de Ridley Scotts Film über das Überleben eines Astronauten auf einem trostlosen Planeten ist im Herzen die Geschichte eines Schiffbruchs. Obwohl der Plot nichts Neues bietet, sind die Details und auch der Tonfall so wie ich es vorher noch nicht gesehen habe. Matt Damons Mark Watney ist ein Mann, der all sein Einfallsreichtum und seinen Mut für eine unmögliche Situation bündelt, um sie zu ertragen. Vor allem muss er die ungeheure Einsamkeit aushalten. Es ist nicht so, dass die Twentieth Century Fox einen Film bezahlen würde, in dem der Astronaut am Ende stirbt. Es fragt sich also nicht, was passieren wird, sondern wie es passiert. Glücklicherweise basiert Ridley Scotts Film auf einem intelligenten Drehbuch von Drew Goddard, dass unter anderem untersucht, wie man einen gerissenen Astronauten Helm auf dem Mars repariert oder ohne genug Nahrung überlebt. Die Antworten lauten: Man fixiert den Helm mit Tape und baut mit seiner eigenen Scheisse Kartoffeln an. Obwohl The Martian lang ist, war mir keine Minute langweilig. Vor allem liegt das daran, dass wir mit Matt Damons Mark einen ständig zu Witzen aufgelgten, permanent mit sich selbst redenden Helden vor uns haben, der auch noch sehr begabt ist als Botaniker. Meine Beschreibung mag den Anschein haben, dass The Martian berechenbar ist. Das stimmt, dennoch nimmt es dem Film nichts von seiner Effektivität. Das Faszinierendste dabei: The Martian versucht nicht viel gegen seine Berechenbarkeit zu unternehmen und lässt sich nicht zu Effekthascherei herab. Von allen Weltraum Filmen, in denen Astronauten ähnliches widerfährt, ist The Martian der lustigste und warmherzigste. So erleben wir eine Mischung aus beeindruckenden rotbraunen Panorama Landschaftsbildern vom Mars, Matt Damons putzigem Gesicht und Disco Klassikern der 70er (die einzige Musik, auf die er zurückgreifen kann): Rock The Boat, Hot Stuff oder Waterloo. Ein bisschen wirkt der Film wie eine TV Show ohne Skript: Mark erklärt uns in seinen Selbstgesprächen, was er als nächstes tun wird (meistens gehts dabei um Problemlösungen). Für einen Ridley Scott Film ist das ungewöhnlich, kennen wir den Briten doch eher für düster dramatische Stoffe. Dieser leichte Humor aber steht ihm viel besser! Schön fand ich, wie Amerikaner und Chinesen gemeinsam daran arbeiten, den verlorenen Astronauten zurückzuholen. Die Rettung: Waghalsig und unvermutet, ermöglicht durch zwei irrsinnige Ideen... Am Ende werden Millionen Menschen Zeuge dessen (auch hier ist The Martian wie eine TV Show zugespitzt) - niemand aber bekommt einen Eindruck von seinen Ängsten und seiner Existenz zwischen Leben und Tod. Er wirkt älter, sitzt auf einer Bank. Vor ihm spriesst ein kleiner Steckling aus dem Boden - ähnlich seiner Kartoffeln, die er auf dem Mars angebaut hatte.

5.0,"Legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Thelma & Louise!)is back in action with 2015's sci fi masterwork ''The Martian'' Ridley Scott shows us why he is still relevant and still a great filmmaker in hollywood, because he blew everything away with one of this years best movies.

Going in i was afraid this movie was somehow going to be bad since Ridley Scott hasn't done a deal of great things since Gladiator, so me expectations were low, and on top of that i was prepared to witness an incredibly depressing and dower but great survival story (like The Revenant), but man was i wrong, I had some of the most fun watching this movie, i laughed so surprisingly hard at many points throughout the film, man what a special treat.

When a movie like this can achieve both incredible, emotionally driven story and acting (Matt Damon was phenomenal by the way, also one of the best in years for him) and be hilarious, uplifting and witty at many points throughout the film, a movie like this gets my vote as (one of the) Best Picture ('s) of the year.",Calib M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Feb 26, 2016",Calib M,/user/id/973448452,RT,973448452,,The Martian

4.0,"Entertaining, dense, intriguing and emotionally powerful; showman filmmaker Ridley Scott's The Martian has delivered everything you would expect from a thrilling space rescue adventure and something you wouldn't, a good dose of humor. 

When a fierce windstorm rips through the site of a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is injured, left behind and presumed dead. But even to his own surprise, he survives.

Humor and problem solving his greatest tools, Watney resourcefully and determinately sets to devising a plan for survival. Addressing the myriad of challenges; Watney grows crops in an uninhabitable environment, makes contact with people light-years away and stays sane by talking to his ever present company of non-transmitting cameras. But can his ingenuity, wit and spirit hold out until help arrives?

Adapted closely from the most unlikely of sources, The Martian is a survival movie in the extreme, successfully teetering between a Gravity-esque universal epic and a Castaway intimate solitary endeavor. 

Set in the perfect tone (with only one slightly contrived geo-political misstep to detract from its cinematic value) the many strands the storyline never feel fragmented, no matter the distance between characters or believability of concept. 

Damon carries the film squarely his broad shoulders and although not embraced very often, the chocker block supporting cast (Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor to mention a few) is wonderfully strong. 

The Verdict: With grace and appealing irreverence, the documentation of a solitary dilemma has finally found a way to become uplifting.

5.0,"Having read the book, this was a must see. Now to be fair the only way to make a movie that completely reflects the contents of the book, requires the film-maker to make it so long that no one will be able to bear watching it. This simply the way things are.
Yes, they took some shortcuts, they had to. Yes, they left out some scenes and information, they had to do that too. One cannot take a 382 page book and cram it into two hours and ten minutes without cutting a few corners. Things that were covered quite thoroughly in the book had to be presented visually in the movie. This requires close attention on the part of the viewer. It is also something Ridley Scott does brilliantly.
I liked that Matt Damon played the lead. I thought Jessica Chastain was the perfect choice for mission commander. She is more than capable of playing the tough, competent woman. She proved that in ""Zero Dark Thirty.""
Perhaps the most important element they made a point of retaining was the main character's sense of humor. Sometimes dark, but always self-effacing, Watney's ability to laugh at himself was as much a factor in saving his own life as his ingenuity. This was in the book as well and is what made Weir's novel such a joy to read.
This is where Matt Damon shines.
True to Weir's concept, the science presented was solid. Drew Goddard (screen-writer) did a brilliant job of adaptation. He left out what could be gotten away with, and kept the meat of the story very much alive.
This is at least as good as ""Interstellar"" and in some ways is better. ""Interstellar"" is far more speculative.

Mark Watney is abandoned on Mars when a storm hits the crew and he is presumed dead.  He stays in some NASA established shelters on the planet and does everything he can to grow foods, cut rations, and hope he can survive long enough to be rescued.  

""I am going to have to science the shit out of this.""

Ridley Scott, director of Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane, Black Hawk Down, Hannibal, Matchstick Men, American Gangsters, and Prometheus, delivers The Martian.  The storyline for this picture is just okay, straightforward, and not overly creative.  The acting is solid and the special effects were pretty good.  The cast delivers great performances and includes Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, and Michael Pena.

""My balls are frozen.""

I was interested in this film based on the high ratings, Oscar discussions, and previews when it was first in theatres.  We grabbed this from Red Box and watched it over Valentines weekend and this was well done but on par with Gravity as good but not epic.  I recommend seeing this once but wouldn't add it to my DVD collection.

So basically, it was the opposite of the Blade Runner (which I loved, don't get me wrong). The Martian, which depicts astronaut Mark Watney's fiasco in space was not exactly what I was expecting when I bought a ticket to a Ridley Scott movie about the future. The trailer also tricked me into thinking this was going to be a suspense filled, hard to watch action thriller. But when I sat down with my large bucket of popcorn (extra butter) I was pleased to find out I was wrong. After the stress inducing watching experiences of both Gravity and Interstellar, I thought that this particular space movie was a good change of pace. The foul-mouthed, disco-hating, Mark's humor kept the tone light. However, this didn't detract from the movie's more serious moments. Matt Damon (my fave) had plenty of opportunities to show off his dramatic acting chops, and he was (deservingly) nominated for an Oscar for it.

2.5,"Perhaps it was the (nonsensical) Golden Globe nomination as a musical/Comedy or the Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but I had pretty high hopes fo rthis movie. Finally a decent looking Sci-Fi movie that is not 2.5 hours long!  While not exactly disappointed, this movie was very underwhelming. Too much back and forth between Earth and Mars made his situation seem a bit less overwhelming than it really would be. In the hands of a more adventurous director this could have been a great opportunity to explore the psychological impact of his ordeal, while still presenting the same story. While Matt Damon did a solid job, this was a one man show, despite not needing to be. The other characters were largely poorly written and developed with plenty of unnecessary characters coming and going, performing functions which could easily have been done with existing characters. The inclusion of the ""PR"" person was completely pointless, feeling more like a ""Hey we have more than one woman in this movie! We are diverse!"" overture. At the end of the day this is not a ""Castaway"" in space type of movie, which may have been more interesting. ""Alone in space"" has been done before and better in almost every way (pure science - Interstellar; psychological impact - Moon; action - Alien and the sequels).

5.0,I love Ridley Scott´s films. The Martian is my favourite of his  because it is a supremely entertaining science fiction interpretation of Andy Weir´s incredibly funny science fiction. Long term survival chances cannot be more grim if one is stranded on Mars alone with limited food and O2. Being a botanist and an electrical plus chemical engineer can extend life a bit more. But ultimately it is the team that is so willing to turn around their space ship in a heart beat to fetch you home can there be a remote chance of living to a ripe old age. It is the spirit of camaraderie of the fellow astronauts turning around to fetch the martian against all odds with minimal chance of success that makes this film so triumphantly uplifting and moving.,Chiek E,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Feb 16, 2016",Chiek E,/user/id/787970104,RT,787970104,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/733446064/picture,The Martian

4.0,"Matt Damon impressed me again in this movie, his portrayal of Watney was simultaneously funny and heart wrenching. The movie was surprisingly like the book, save the copious amount of time taken (in the book) to explain the science behind some of the feats Watney was achieving on Mars (which is understandable due to time constraints). 
My only disappointment was the manner in which Watney grew his potatoes. The movie's portrayal (especially the depth of the soil) makes it almost impossible for potatoes to grow, much less experience such a high-yield as Watney's potatoes did. This is explained and taken care of in the book, but was brushed over in the movie and left me frustrated to say the least (as the potatoes were a main instrument to his survival).
Still, the wit with which Watney approaches his situation is refreshing and hilarious and made the movie all the better.

3.0,"I will be frank:  I was disappointed with this film, despite the fact that I am an avid lover of space travel and science fiction set in the realm of plausibility. Similar to Disney's ""Tron: Legacy,"" I fell in love with the production design, the special effects, and the stunning visual flair that surrounded the protagonists.... but everything else, (particularly the protagonists,) might as well have been dead spuds dehydrating in Martian soil. 

The look of ""The Martian"" is brilliant; that I will admit without hesitation. Never before has an expedition to the red planet been portrayed with such detail, scientific insight, and realism. The filmmakers must have consulted NASA because everything looked authentic. The Martian habitat with its cylindrical nodes was totally livable. The orbital transit vehicle with its massive solar arrays and spinning hub of artificial gravity also seemed straight out of a rocket scientist's simulation. Every control panel button, every zip-lock food package, every storage container, every gold-foiled plating gave strong NASA vibes, and I not only longed to take a journey on one of these crafts, but I felt depressed knowing such things are not on NASA's agenda, (at least not for the next 20 years.) Visually, ""The Martian"" out-did the Big Two films that came before it:  ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar.""

Now that I've stated what I loved about this film, let me now state everything I hated about this film:  everything else. 

The characters were not so much real characters are stand-in archetypes. Matt Damon comes off as a lucky smart-ass who laughs in the face of danger, calls himself a space cowboy, and frequently vents his disapproval of the Captain's choice in music as much as other problems like, you know, staying alive 200 million miles from earth before starving to death. (Just little things like that.) Apart from the initial scene where he plucks the skewer from his gut, Damon rarely shows fear; there was surprisingly little frustration on his part, considering he's surviving on Mars alone for almost two years. The rest of the cast, (apart from Damon's fellow crew-mates,) were just as unimpressive. The manner Damon and the earthly NASA crew came up with inventions came off as dumb, more like Discovery Channel ""Mythbusters"" than real scientists trying to find real solutions to real problems. While using Mars Pathfinder as a communication device was super-cool, the whole delivery came off as those aforementioned guys who blow up soda bottles and balloons in the name of ""science"" just to elicit ""cooooool man!"" comments and ""woooo hoooo!!!!"" cheers from the rest of the ""bros."" For this very reason, I sometimes forgot I was watching an actual movie and not some loud television program made for the scientifically illiterate. 
Ridley Scott had the strange notion that interjecting badly-timed humor in the more-desperate second half of the film was a brilliant idea; in reality, this detracted to the somber situation of the matter, making the whole film resemble ""Armageddon"" more than, let's say, ""Apollo 13."" The height of the film's stupidity peaked with the ""Project Elrond"" scene which not only should have been cut in the editing room, but every trace of this scene should have been burned and removed from human memory. Sean Bean's smug recognition to the ""Lord of the Rings"" was done solely to remind audiences that he played Boromir; this practically ruined the second half of the film for me; the scene was unnecessary and completely patronizing to fanboys. I also could have lived without the ""Iron Man"" references, and the strange fact that the soundtrack was loaded with 70's oldies just to be on the same playing field as ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" The soundtrack fell flat, and the most upbeat disco songs were included in scenes that would have been better with dramatic score or, (better yet,) no music. 

Perhaps I'm being overly critical of this film because my expectations were sky-high and I expected more from a Best Picture nominee. (Just my luck it's probably going to win...) But as a Best Picture nominee, it deserves to be scrutinized in every way possible. The three stars I give ""The Martian"" are solely for the visual effects department and the fantastic, gob-smacking employment of real science to bring the various spacecraft and Martian habitats to real life. Forget the humans; the real stars of this film were the airlocks.",Kenneth E,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Feb 14, 2016",Kenneth E,/user/id/796920293,RT,796920293,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/726047433/picture,The Martian

4.5,"Like most of you out there, I wasn't very keen on watching ""The Martian"" at first. In my mind it was just another fictitious astronaut film, and don't take me wrong, The Martian IS a fiction movie, but...

What got me to want to watch this movie was one afternoon when I was scrolling down on facebook and a video about The Martian showed up, so out of curiosity, I gave it a look. This was a video of real-life scientists talking about how fictitious the film actually is. It turns out the film was pretty realistic! [Here's the link to the Wired video/ article (it might have some spoilers but it's worth it even if just to convince you to watch it): http://www.wired.com/2015/10/nasa-martian-fact-check/]

So a couple of weeks ago my roommate and I gave it a watch. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I'm going to try to ""abstractly"" explain to you how awesome I think it is. First of all, the director introduced comedy to this kind of movie, which in my opinion is very well done, considering that these kinds of movies are always very tense and stressful so it's nice to laugh a bit once in a while. Then the actors did an amazing job (*clap* *clap* to Matt Damon), and so did the director, I mean, this movie has you on the edge of your seat for over 2 hours! Anyway, since I don't want to spoil anything that's all I'll say about the movie and if that's not enough, here's a NASA article about the real technologies used in the movie (https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nine-real-nasa-technologies-in-the-martian).

I was so excited about this movie that I decided to buy and read the book. Now, most people will tell you that books are always better than movies, I couldn't disagree more (at least in this specific case). Furthermore, I'll tell you that you'll be better off reading it after watching the movie rather than before. I say this because the book is the written version of the film, with extras, which means that if you love the film, there is something else about the story that you can know! Isn't that just everyone's dream?...

In case you're thinking about reading this book and are about to go read some reviews I can tell you right now what most of the bad ones will say that sucks about this book-the way it's written, which is diary-style + humor. I personally loved it but ""haters"" couldn't bare the fact that a person stranded on Mars would write a diary for someone to one day read his adventures in case he couldn't do it himself, much less with sarcasm. Why? Just why? Why couldn't this random person be sarcastic. Can't astronauts be sarcastic? C'mon people...

4.5,"Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival.

After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead.  Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive..

A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott.  Engrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going.  The resourcefulness stretches beyond a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home.  This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together.

While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS right - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies.  

Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role.  Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish.

Generally not so with this :- A well directed and acted film. Reasonably light and positive with enough natural dialogue to keep you engaged. 
Matt Damon (Mark Watney) again impresses without having to do too much and, I think, has turned into a good, understated, actor. 
Some of the ""matter of fact"" and logical scenes when he was working things out felt quite real and subsequently made me feel cheerfully emotional!
I'm sure much of what Mark Watney achieves while stranded is somewhat fantastical but it does tend to show how people can adapt and survive in difficult circumstances.

4.0,"Without spoiling too much, it's hard to come up with a sci-fi film that's so crowd-pleasing and cheerful as this one.  I suppose that does spoil some elements of the film but, seriously, think of the last time that you saw a film like this where the tone is surprisingly upbeat with a lot of comedic content.  While I really did enjoy Interstellar, perhaps more than a lot of other people did, I still didn't think it was great because, parts of it, felt way too self-indulgent.  I feel that The Martian, which was probably already in production by the time Interstellar came out, perhaps subconsciously, was an effort to be the complete opposite of Interstellar.  I don't wanna say the plot to the film is simplistic, because it's not, but it's a more stripped-down.  Essentially, this is a rescue mission.  There's no talk about time travel, what happens when you go down through a black hole, space-time continuum.  None of that.  While the film does feature a lot of science heavy dialogue, it's never to the point where you're completely lost as to what these people are talking about.  You know what they mean when they say it.  The plot of the film is straightforward, but the journey to get to the endgame is what makes the film so damn great.  The film sees Mark Watney's attempts to survive on Mars long enough for a rescue mission to come his way after the crew of his original mission left him behind fearing him dead during a storm.  Of course, the crew of the original mission is also the same crew that carries out the rescue mission, to bring things full circle from a narrative standpoint.  What I liked about the Watney's character, and the film in general, is how he chooses to refuse to die on Mars.  The tone to Watney's confessionals help keep the tone serious, but not too serious.  As I mentioned there's a lot of comedy from Watney himself in order to keep from becoming depressed about the situation that he currently finds himself in.  Another thing that helps is that Watney chooses to keep himself busy, in that he has to or else he'd die, by planting crops, finding viable sources of water, etc.  He tackles one problem at a time and that helps keep him occupied and away from darker thoughts about the loneliness he suffers from or anything else.  The movie did a good job at not letting things get too dark, in fact, other than some curse words and some brief nudity, this is a perfectly acceptable family movie.  Seriously.  Like I'm not joking about that.  This is a movie that the entire family can sit down and watch.  While there are its more serious moments where it feels like the mission is at risk of or near failure, the movie is never overcome by its more serious moments.  There's a hopeful, optimistic tone to this and it's one of the film's stronger aspects, particularly in the face of super serious sci-fi films like Interstellar or Gravity, which I still think is a masterpiece, it helps set it apart from those flicks.  The film is well-written and it also helps that you have such a great cast on hand.  Seriously, the cast in this film is top-notch.  There's so much talent here.  But, realistically speaking, this is the Matt Damon show, as it should be.  Damon really does give one of, if not, his best performances ever.  He was excellent in True Grit but that was a supporting role, as far as leading roles, I don't think I've ever seen Damon look better than he did in this movie.  He's funny and he's charismatic, but you can also see that he's, not necessarily desperate, but eager to get off this planet.  This planet that he, literally, is the only person to have ever done anything.  He's the first person to go to any point in Mars that he chooses to go to, he's the first person to grow crops on Mars, etc.  I think there's a certain pride about being the first and only human to do these things, but he's also, clearly, eager to leave this planet after his, realistically, horrifying ordeal.  An ordeal that would've, surely, led to suicide in most cases.  I know this is a fictional situation, but let's be real here.  The supporting cast is really strong.  I don't wanna say that none of them stand out because, really, I think there's a lot of real good characters in the film, but there's obviously not as much focus put on them as there is put on Watney.  As was to be expected, the film is beautifully shot and it does accurately capture how desolate Mars must seem to a person that has been left behind on the red planet.  The special effects in the film are really impressive as well, but there's not as much focus on them since the story is about Watney's survival and subsequent rescue mission.  The rescue mission itself is exciting and thrilling and, really, there's sort of an emotional release for Watney to finally come in contact with other humans after a year of being stuck in Mars.  It's a moment that's earned and one that doesn't feel forced in or to sentimental.  It makes sense that Watney would react the way he did, so I thought that worked and it's just one of those moments that'll have a lot of people with a lump in their throats, just out of sheer happiness.  Honestly, I can't really say enough good about this movie.  The acting is excellent, the writing is really smart, the film's presentation is top-notch and it's a surprisingly funny movie.  I wouldn't call it the best film from 2015, but it's an excellent regardless.  I would highly recommend it, it works if you're an art house fan or someone with more casual tastes.

4.0,"In this intriguingly brave and courageous movie ""The Martian"", a team of astronauts explore the planet Mars, a massive wind storm struck the planet which in result left the crew panicking for an evacuation. Knowing they were one short of their full team, they left the planet assuming their left behind crew member Mark Watney was dead. Consequently of the crews assumption, Mark Watney is actually alive and well. Realizing that his team had left him, Mark begins a strategic plan to keep himself alive while trying to communicate to Earth miles and miles away that he is not dead.
               As Mark Watney's crew later finds out that he is alive, they began to feel ultimate guilt and that they are obligated to go back and get their team member. For the concern of the crew, NASA did not agree for the team to go back to Mars but later realized this was bigger than just a successful mission; it was a mans life. As both NASA and Mr. Watney work endlessly trying to keep him alive, the whole world is rooting for them, and with much confidence and support Watney even shows some humor during his strategically intense living on Mars to try and lighten the mood for everybody. As the strong crew and ""Martian"" Mark Watney do not give up he hopes to meet up with his crew again and come back home in a heroic manner. Although the film seems to draw some scenes out too far, it is still a best seller and a great movie.",keegan b,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Feb 10, 2016",keegan b,/user/id/973367641,RT,973367641,,The Martian

4.0,"Science fiction master filmmaker Ridley Scott returns to form with The Martian, an entertaining, intelligent, timely, and gorgeous film. Set in the not too distant future, the film follows an ill-fated mission to Mars that leaves one astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), stranded. Through ingenuity, cunning pragmatism, and sheer will Watney is able to survive while an Earth-based NASA scrambles to conceive of a rescue mission.

In many ways, The Martian captures what Ridley's previous sci-fi films did so well, capture a sense of vastness that makes space both immaculately beautiful and also daunting, while at the same time keeping the story anchored to the characters. These lead to his greatest success in both Alien and Blade Runner and while The Martian is not in those leagues, it still remains quite competent. To be sure, the caliber of the cast helped with this, as Matt Damon really did do a masterful job, keeping the humanity and charm of his character while also becoming increasingly vulnerable. The rest of the cast ranges from quite capable (Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain) to a bit underwhelming (Kristin Wiig, Kate Mara). Yet Ridley keeps the focus on the human dynamics at play, and never sacrifices story for spectacle.
Ridley also shows a certain restraint for most of the film. His methodical buildups are signature, and the Martian is true to form. The characters are given time to grow, and we greatly enjoy seeing the humor and brilliant Watney is able to conjure up in the face of such a barren situation. We grow with him, and become extremely invested in his fate.

To be sure, the film is not without some flaws. There was more than a few PC strains running through it. The multi cultural cast was pronounced and seemed more a ploy for wider marketing success than an organic outgrowth to the story, specifically the awkward subplot involving the Chinese. Moreover, the last act becomes increasingly unrealistic and nearly botches all of the dramatic license that Ridley had bought for it by his prior restraint. We still stay with the film, but credibility becomes greatly strained.

Overall, a strong film.

The visuals were gorgeous & I love how everything had a sense of realism.

3.5,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, it was incredibly watchable and Matt Damon's character was clever, funny, but also very empathetic. We can understand that feeling loneliness, so we can understand what he must feel like having nobody else around him. But this has the entirely new dimension of being on a completely uninhabited planet, where making food seems impossible, breathing is impossible, and surviving doesn't sound like an option. So what makes Matt's character in this so brilliant is his reaction to his circumstances. He doesn't give up, or hope that somebody will come and save him. He decides to 'science the shit out of this'. Not only that, but the guy who is stuck on another planet is the funniest one in the entire film!

I think it's a great way of describing how sometimes it doesn't feel like there is anybody out there that can give you a hand, you feel like you are completely alone. But instead of rolling over, you should crack a joke, and get on with making your life better, because there could be something just round the corner that you don't know about, as opposed to just going mad from the ridiculous circumstances you might be in (because it could be worse, you could be on Mars). It gives such an amazing contrast between chaos and happiness that really speaks to a lot of people.

It is also an incredible advertisement for engineers. The amount of times where there was some major catastrophe, and it could be solved with some good engineering practice and some generic equipment was brilliant. You can only hope that some teenagers might see this film and wonder how on earth you can manage to go into space and fix your suit with duct tape, and be inspired into a career of science or engineering. It seems to take a lot of ideas from the Apollo 13 mission and subsequent film, and I don't mean that in as a slight. The kind of problem solving aspect of Apollo 13 was a key element to the Martian throughout the whole film.

The direction of the film definitely changes for the last forty minutes or so. I will not spoil any plots so don't worry about that, however it did seem to turn a little bit into a few scenes from Interstellar towards the end. I was hoping for a 'survival guide to Mars' kind of film. I had hoped that there would be lots of shots of incredible landscapes, maybe get to see the are with Mt. Olympus, and watch as this character changes over the period of living on Mars. I also feel that it would have given a much more dramatic and climactic ending. However even though there were some good landscape shots, there were not as many as I would have expected, nor as adventurous as Interstellar and the black hole for instance. The plot seemed to change to more of a rescue mission, which I feel was a bit of get out to what it could have been, and was unnecessarily complicated during the final scenes.

None of this deterred from the enjoyment of the film. I thought that Chiwetal Ejiofor was fantastic as always, Jessica Chastain didn't seem to have a lot to do for the majority of the film, and I  just can't accept her as an astronaut. I think she would have been better suited in NASA in a similar role as Jeff Daniels. It was funny in all the right places, but as there were ups there were some necessary downs as well. If you were wondering whether you should see the Martian, then I would urge you to see it, even if it is just to see Matt Damon, who is as always exceptional as the Martian.",Michael L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Feb 03, 2016",Michael L,/user/id/910941933,RT,910941933,,The Martian

2.5,"Director Ridley Scott has always been somewhat of a mixed-bag and I think it's fair to say that audiences don't always connect with his material. However, science fiction has proven to be the genre where he has excelled the most. Alien and Blade Runner are rightly regarded as two of the best but his revisit to the Alien world with Prometheus didn't hit the high benchmark he had set for himself. With this in mind, I entered into The Martian - his fourth science fiction endeavour - with a mixture of anticipation and reservation.

A manned mission on Mars goes awry when a storm hits and the crew has to abort the mission. During the evacuation, astronaut and botanist, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck and presumed dead. When he awakes, he find himself alone and stranded. With limited provisions and limited time, Watney must find a way to contact NASA and inform them of his survival.

When the 2015 Golden Globes were announced a lot of people had questions as to why The Martian was categorised as a comedy. It seemed like a bizarre decision and looked like they were trying to shoehorn the film into a category so it had a chance of winning something. It eventually went on to take Best Picture and Damon Best Actor in a musical or comedy. A none too shabby 7 Oscar nominations followed and it would seem that The Martian had something to offer.

I'm sad to say that I must have missed that something. All the awards buzz surrounding the film lulled me into a false sense of security. To be perfectly frank, I expected something much better than what Ridley Scott delivers here. This should not have won at the Golden Globes or even been considered for the Oscars. This is not Best Picture caliber and as appealing as Damon is, there have been far worthier performances than his over the course of 2015. The most ridiculous of all, though, is Drew Goddard's lazy and childlike screenplay. The Martian plays out like a colour-by-numbers affair. Everything is spelled out for us with Damon's Mark Watney relaying his experiences to a video diary where he talks directly to the screen. As direct (or supposedly indirect) as it may be, Damon pretty much breaks the fourth wall on a consistent basis. By doing so, he basically takes us by the hand and walks us through the film by stating the obvious. This probably won't bother many viewers but I found it lazy, contradictory and insulting storytelling. Admittedly, I never read Andy Weir's book on which it's based so I can't comment on the structure he used in the original source material. However, what works in literary form doesn't necessarily have to be the case in visual form. The beauty of film is that it's a medium that can adopt a different approach but I got the impression that Scott and Goddard didn't trust the intelligence of their audience and went for the safe option. The whole narrative structure felt patronising to me. 

Just to clarify my stance on this; The Martian is pleasantly entertaining. I'm not disputing that, but that's all it is. For a space survival film of this kind, it has an odd feel to it. In some sense you can see why it was considered in the comedy category at the Globes. It's playful and Damon gets to show his lighter, likeable side while under extreme pressure in a seriously grave situation. In his predicament you'd expect a little more angst and loneliness but no, not Damon's Watney. He wisecracks about how he'll ""science the shit out of this""  and is generally cool about the whole thing. As a result, the tone of The Martian is not as I expected. I expected the sombreness and desperation of Gravity or the torturous isolation of Tom Hanks in Cast Away but what I got was a happy-go-lucky, disco dancing Damon.

What Scott does deliver on is his usual visionary approach to the genre. The production design of the Mars landscapes are undeniably impressive but ultimately this is yet another misfire from him. Prometheus was his fall from science-fiction grace and The Martian does nothing to change that. I doubt it'll win any Oscars (at least not the major ones) but it really shouldn't even be in the running at all. It's mediocre and Ex-Machina was a far superior science fiction film which took a major snubbing in so many categories. Surely the academy ticked the wrong boxes when it came to voting between these films?

If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs... then you obviously haven't grasped the situation. Make of that what you will.

5.0,"I feel compelled to write about this amazing movie.  Let me tell you why I loved it, why I think simply everyone should see it.  We are bombarded with movies about bad guys, zombies, corruption in government, deep hatred between countries, violence against all walks of life, and every other negative sensationalism you can conjure in your mind - it's out there and we pay money to subject ourself to this type of ""entertainment.""  I believe the influence this type of media has on people, generally, is huge.  Let me clarify - I do not live in a bubble.. and I do not believe people cannot think for themselves.. but I believe what we put in our minds is there to stay.  Whether we cultivate it or not is our choice.  That being said.. I stand up and applaud the writers/producers/directors/actors of this movie!  This movie takes a seemingly hopeless situation and fills it with hope - even after many setbacks - NO ONE GIVES UP when the going gets tough.  Equally important, this movie portrays women as brilliant heroines, right alongside men.  This movie takes black, white, hispanic, asian, etc. and puts us on equal ground - each possessing admirable qualities that work synergistically to success.  This movie favorably portrays a Far East country that we have traditionally considered oppositional - a country that without hesitation makes a selfless move to align with the US to work as one to save a soul.  This movie has heart  and (with the exception of an F-bomb fired for effect) takes the negative, evil, hateful, selfish, out of the limelight and makes you feel honestly good.

4.0,"It does what ""Cast Away"" did but only better, ""The Martian"" is a story of the human spirit and our will to survive. Matt Damon does an excellent job as an astronaut Mark Watney, who get's left behind in Mars when he is belived to have died in a storm. Stranded, he has to make himself solve problems about how he would survive for the years to come when he is low on food and how to send a message back to earth about his survival...
While Matt Damon is the backbone of this film, the rest of cast is quite large and equally impressive but still it's mainly the story that keeps you glued to the screen. Watney is a true MacGyver when he's ""science the shit out of it"" mode and there is some humor in it too. Overall, the story was nicely complex and jumping through Mars & Earth it lended a nicely multi-layerd story to us.

Ed Harris expertly leads the actors on the Mission Control team, while Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon act their hearts out in the tiny capsule.  Throw in the problem solving drama of Gary Sinise and you have, dare I say, the perfect bring'em home alive movie. None of this occurs in the Martian.  The power-house actors are there, but the film leaves their talent at the door.

I wanted to like the movie.  Mars is a favorite subject of mine.  I've been reading and consuming red planet knowledge for decades.  I could forgive the plethora of scientific inaccuracies if I could have been treated to a more compelling film.  It was enjoyable, it was a good family blockbuster where everyone comes away smiling. The visuals were top notch, probably the most enjoyable aspect of the piece.  Mars has never been rendered so aesthetically accurate, but it all quickly just becomes a set piece as the very real dangers of Mars are forgotten in favor of MacGyver montages and pithy quips.

That being said, the castaway portion of the film before Watney makes contact with Earth again is the better third of the film.  After that most of the tension just evaporates.  Watney's crew, who were on their return flight to Earth on a mobile ISS are wooden and uninspiring, save the pilot who has a couple of decent moments of genuine gallows humor.  Overall the screenwriters didn't spend enough time setting up plausible scenarios for Watney to solve, and instead forced a series of implausible scenarios together to move the plot along.  The worst of it came at the end when Watney was asked by NASA to shave weight from the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle), designed to put 6 people back into orbit, because it would end up to far away from the passing rescue craft.  This set up a groan inducing finish that was a cut and paste of the ending of Red Planet. 

No doubt, based on the audience reviews at Rotten Tomatoes that many people like the film, and I think it's because it is the kind of fun loving drama you'd expect to see on The Wonderful World of Disney.  Maybe my expectations were too big, but based on what I've read about the novel, the film dropped many of the more serious aspects of the story.  It did indeed reek of wasted potential.",Richard J,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Jan 31, 2016",Richard J,/user/id/901302406,RT,901302406,,The Martian
5.0,"In my opinion, The Martian was the best film of 2015, seeing most of them that came out in the mainstream. Matt Damon was not directed for 90% of this movie, and I think it was a perfect choice to leave him be and let him think how he'd truly handle that situation. This movie deserves the best actor award for Matt Damon and his amazing humanly performance of a man trapped, alone, in outer space.",Sam M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 31, 2016",Sam M,/user/id/973263298,RT,973263298,,The Martian

5.0,"I sat down to watch ""The Martian"" two days ago. I was surprised to discover that it was 'very' good indeed. I thought of my mom during the film and how she's not that into syfy or space type movies. But, honestly, I really don't feel as if you have to be. It is an incredibly good story. Though it takes place mostly in space and on Mars you don't have to be interested or even understand space stuff. It's just a story about surviving until the return home and I read it is actually pretty accurate with NASA and space travel and such.
Another high point I must point out is what I call, 'light moments'. They are very comical and provide a great relief to the survival on a hostile planet. These moments are actually what make ""The Martian"" a story and not just another space movie. These scenes add that character development and encourage the audience to get emotionally attached if only a little bit for you hardcore people.
Finally, as you know, I must talk about the musical score. It was fantastic and very fitting especially during the comic relief moments. It was never over imposing in terms of dynamics and Henry Gregson-Williams did an excellent job in contrasting between the heavy feel in moments of trial and things going south and with light moments. The light musicality played a large role in giving the comic relief moments that power and storytelling ability they had.
Overall, a very well down movie that greatly surprised me. I was not sure I'd like it. The ending was such a great summary and culmination of all the trials through the movie and is arguable one of the best scenes in the movie in my opinion.

I ended up giving it a go because it was the only movie I hadn't seen yet that I would be ok with letting my daughter watch as well.

I wasn't expecting funny and Matt Damon seemed to have a lot of fun with it.  His narrative often explained plot holes before I could point them out in a rather tongue in cheek way that I enjoyed.

4.0,"A Ridley Scott film - starring Matt Damon - tells a story of a stranded austonaut in Mars. The film was compared with Nolan's Interstellar, which later I will share my thoughts about it.

The film was GREAT sci-fi film - touching, inspirational, funny, but with high suspense, and mostly accurate with science.

Matt Damon was incredible. He made the character looked very much alive and surviving. 

The scenery or the visual effect was incredible and well placed. I saw a lot of movie with fucked-up visual effect - especially sci-fi. But, the really nailed it with this movie!.

The scoring - which was made by Harry Gregson-Williams - was also great. I mean when you hear it, the score feels like it was made for an every day living drama. But, how amazing Williams put it on another planet! Also the soundtrack! HAHA! They're hillarious!

Now, I'm going to compare it with Interstellar (2014).

Overall - for me - Interstellar was still winning with its genius director, Christopher Nolan. 

The Martian (2015) can't defeat Intertellar's puzzle and mind-fucked situation. But The Martian won because of the characters - they are easily identified. We usually know what our next emotions would be as the film ran. Interstellar lacks of this, we don't know what the emotions are next. Because of the puzzle of course.

On the technical side, Interstellar used traditional technology - which is still very effective. The actors can feel more of the real atmosphere. The Martian used green screen - nuff said.

Also the scoring. How can you defeat Hans Zimmer? I still like to hear Interstellar's ORIGINAL music. The Martian lacks of its originality of music.

But I still like both of them as sci-fi movies. These two movies proofs themselves to me that they are both intelligent. Even though they lack at some point.

THE VERDICT:
The Martian is smart, funny - with high suspense - with strong cast and very effective use of science.

Basically it's the story of a guy who wasted billions (trillions?) of dollars and multiple lifetimes' worth of man-hours all because he wanted to be rescued.

Pretty sure any real astronaut who made it to Mars would not be thinking, okay now everyone drop everything to get me back to Earth. For what!? Suck it up, do some experiments, say thank you, eat the food you have and then clock out you fool. It's what you signed up for.

But, okay, that's the story. It's a movie, I get it. And I get that everyone has to read their emails out loud and react to them for the cameras. But at a certain point--right around where ""Calculations correct"" actually shows up in a prompt on DonGlover's screen--I can't help but start to feel insulted. I mean, fine, whatever.

4.5,"Rating: 4.5 out of 5 

When someone tells you the synopsis of this movie being ""Matt Damon is stuck on Mars and they need to bring him back"" you instantly think of Tom Hanks in Castaway... but this movie (which I didn't see in the cinema) is more than that and one I regret not seeing on the big screen. 

Matt Damon portrays a botanist ""Mark Watney"" in a movie where due to bad weather on Mars is left for dead but survives. It's up to him and his whit to work out how to survive on Mars and find a way to get back home. 

While no one has never been to Mars, You can't help thinking how plausible everything Matt Damon does in the movie. Generally you go ""Bullshit, this would never work"" but through out this movie you are completely satisfied in thinking that everything he does could work if those issues presented themselves. 

The storyline of the movie keeps you wanted to cheer Matt Damon on and the acting from everyone is first class. 

I've heard the book takes it to another level and worth reading, but this movie while 2 and half hours long, was enjoyable from start to finish.

3.5,"I don't get this film. I will not be seduced by potatoes and one-liners. The Martian forces us into a graphic confrontation with the mechanics, biology, psychology, physiology, programming and physics of a survival-and-rescue mission: so it suffers when the pieces don't add up.

The biggest piece is that Mars does-and-does-not have an atmosphere of note. An horrific storm is the catalyst to the story, yet a parachute is all that is needed to cover his craft for launch - and a tarp is all that is needed to sufficiently pressurise his cabin. None of this adds up.

Where does he get his oxygen from? His oxygen tanks are always full, the rover always has air and the cabin is able to restore its atmosphere after expelling everything into the vacuum. This doesn't make sense.

Donald Glover appears to give us caculations-ex-machina (literally), we see he's used a supercomputer to crunch the numbers yet the numbers are wrong. These ""numbers"" are confirmed twice more by other scientists - yet the information is withheld that the only way the numbers can be adhered to is for drastic modification of the craft - and even then, the calculations are wrong and both the Hermes and Damon have to take drastic measures to course-correct.

The Martian had too much detail for my taste, and by the time you get towards the build up towards the end, you can't wait for the movie to finish already. Matt Damon never did anything for me as an actor, and this movie has a whole lot of him. Too much Matt Damon isn't good for any movie. Yes, I think he's overrated. Throw in the fact that The Martian was nominated for Best Picture, you have to seriously wonder if he has a friend at the Academy, or someone there really love the director, Ridley Scott, who's work I do respect. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments, the screenplay was well done, the script had some humor, and they did well making Mars, look like the Mars we see in photos, but it wasn't Star Wars. I honestly got more entertainment from ""Straight Outta Compton"", an Oscar snub, and I'm sure it's spot could have been replaced with a number of other Indie movies that the Academy snubbed as well, like maybe ""Creed"", ""Beast of No Nation"", or ""Concession"", to name a few.

The script sizzles (Thank you Drew Goddard), the acting is great all around (with the standouts being Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor), and the soundtrack is tops. Despite some real serious subject material (We're dealing with a man's struggle to survive despite almost insurmountable odds), The Martian manages to be a very funny and fun film. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It's also a notable film because we get to watch Ridley Scott rise like a Phoenix from the ashes. Could this be a new start for the once great director? Only time will tell, I suppose. The Martian is a phenomenal, moving, and touching film that is one of the ultimate tales of man vs. nature (Yupp, I'm gonna say this one is WAY better than The Revenant).

4.0,"A great movie all around, which should be expected when Ridley Scott is dealing with excellent source material.  My only criticism is that Scott did not invest enough in the actors.  The film could have been much more powerful if Matt Damon had been allowed to play up the personal, emotional struggles of isolation and fear his character must have been going through -- as he has proven he is able to do -- rather than having him appear to be chipper and relatively confident throughout his harrowing ordeal.  

Daniels, Ejiofor, Chastain and Mara also have proven abilities to dig deeper than the characters Scott gave us.  The sole cognizable attempt at emotional expression and conflict was in Sean Bean's character, and it was a complete misfire.  This is likely to be the only movie I'll ever see where Kristen Wiig is the deepest well of emotional expression.

4.5,"The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.

Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-ass and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully pissed off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.

His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.

The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of ""suit camera - Watney.""

There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.

In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.

4.5,"Not a comedy, but great movie. Matt Damon was incredible & deserved to win the Golden Globe.  I'm not a fan of science fiction at all, but when it won the Golden Globe, I was intrigued. The movie is suspenseful. I found it somewhat hard to believe at points (that this senario could actually happen & everyone survives), but I guess that's why it's science fiction. The movie kept me captivated the entire time. Not being a fan of this type of movie, I never saw it in theatres. I'm glad that I gave it a chance & watched the movie as soon as it became available for purchase. I was surprised at how good the movie was.

4.5,"I think it's crazy how good and logical The Martian is compared to a lot of Ridley Scott's recent work. It's definitely now a stand-out in his catalog.

I really really liked the film. It's crazy how easy it is to follow the complex science going on in the story and how entertaining the story continues to be throughout - even though NOT THAT MUCH happens really. The majority of the decisions are made pretty quickly by Matt Damon in Mars and his scenes are typically pretty fast-paced, but everything on Earth takes a couple scenes for each decision to be made and things to be discovered.

Every scene in this film is important and integral to the development to the story - it's insane how lean this script turned out to be. And we still end up with pretty developed main characters (less so on the supporting cast, but they're all still interesting without the extra dev). It's mind-blowing. On top of that, the shots are gorgeous, the story beats rock-solid, and the dramatic action incredibly moving.

4.5,"The Martian is gonna be this season's ""Did you see?"" movie. People will be discussing at work and school and so forth. Being based on a popular book and being both family friendly and brainy enough that just about anyone can enjoy it, it was bound to be a hit. It doesn't hurt however that this is Ridley Scott's best film since his director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven and his best sci-fi movie since Alien. Damon also does some of his best work here. Really, any good actor could've played the part, but Damon also has the advantage of being very likable. Had they placed someone with less behind-the-scenes grace like Christian Bale or Russell Crowe in that spacesuit, the audience may have found it more difficult to identify with him. Damon is one of our good ol' American boys and he is easy to root for.
Some may stay away from The Martian because they, like me at first, feel it all looks a little too familiar after Gravity in 2013 and Interstellar in 2014. While those are both good movies (Gravity in particular), The Martian is actually more akin to something like Apollo 13. The obviously fictional tale is presented so believably it almost feels like a true story. Very little about the film feels far-fetched. Also, a lot of the flaws that were noticeable in those recent films I mentioned are non-existent here. It's almost like Ridley Scott watched Gravity and Interstellar and said ""Ok, lads, you did good, but let me show you how this is done"". I can't stress enough that Scott is really at the top of his game here. I've heard people comment that his films have been hit and miss lately (they've been more hit for me), but this is Oscar-caliber directing and I hope he makes that short list of nominees.
If the trailers didn't make the plot obvious enough-a group of astronauts must abandon their Mars mission early when a dangerous storm approaches their research site. Mark Watney (Damon) is struck by debris and lost in the storm. His crew does attempt to find him, but with a narrow window for escape they must assume he is dead and leave. Watney actually survived the injury and now must find ways to survive alone on Mars until he can make contact with NASA and a rescue mission can be executed. The film then shifts between Watney trying to stay alive, scientists on Earth researching ways to rescue him and his crew aboard the home-bound ship dealing with the guilt of leaving him behind.
The supporting cast is quite a list: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Kristen Wiig, Mackenzie Davis, Benedict Wong and Aksel Hennie. Everyone is good, everyone. But this is Damon's show and they all know it. The other big star here is Mars itself. The visual & special effects teams, the production & art design teams, and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski have all put forth a good effort to make Mars a realistic, almost familiar, place to us. I attended a 3D screening and as far as that is concerned, I would recommend just seeking the largest screen you can. The story is so enthralling that it really doesn't need the 3D gimmick, but there a couple scenes like the storm at the beginning that utilize it well. But more important than 3D, this is a big screen movie. I don't care how fancy you think your home entertainment center is, this should be seen in the theater.
The final quarter of the movie feels a little rushed compared to sections before it that took so much time obsessing over every little detail. However, I have not read the book and that may be more a fault with the source material than the movie itself. Then again, knowing Ridley Scott, there is bound to be a 4 hour director's cut at some point (or a few of them). This pacing issue is such a minor complaint though in a movie with so much to enjoy.

4.5,"On the surface it looks a bit dull doesn't it, like someone making castaway with a lot of space cliches thrown in? I was so glad to be completely wrong. Oh yes there are some cliches and you will at least see a NASA control room all whooping and high fiving once about something or other, but the vast majority of this concentrates on two very interesting stories: On the first hand we have Matt Damon making the journey from finding himself abandoned on Mars to overcoming obstacles of every variety so he can survive the many years his rescue may take. This story is the centre piece and is delivered with perfect directional pace and a number of sciency ideas that are well explained through the script. This keeps his plans interesting rather than baffling, or worst still, obvious, and it is easy to feel attached to the struggle rather than expecting deus ex machina to solve it all hollywood style. Damon makes a brilliant lead here. The second story here is of the team at NASA on earth, overcoming the many publicity and scientific issue involved in saving him. Once again, this is well paced and told in a believable and interesting manner.

5.0,"""The Martian"" is emotionally gripping and notably funny, and is not only accompanied by prodigious visuals and an astounding cast, but is one of the best movies of 2015. 

""The Martian"" is a tale of a manned mission to Mars, and in the event of a terrible storm, one of the astronauts (Mark Watney) is struck by debris, and presumed dead. Turns out, Watney survived, and its up to him to science the s*** out of the situation, while the whole world bands together to show us that humanity is not dead after all. 

I have to start out by saying that this movie was flat out gorgeous. The scenery, the set designs, and the CGI were all very pleasing to the eyes, and it felt like I was actually on Mars. I loved the background and the visuals, and this movie just looked great. Considering its a movie that takes place on another world, it's surprising to say that there were many other factors that were even more notable. I even liked the camera work, and the creative use of different camera angles to capture different perspectives. Again, it makes everything feel so real, and even if you don't like this movie, that doesn't stray from the fact that it looks and was shot great.

The actors in this movie were perfect across the board. There really were too many great performances to talk about each one individually, so I'm going to focus on just one. Matt Damon as Mark Watney was a revelation. He showed us why he's considered to be an amazing actor, and he put on an inspiring performance in this film. His ability to portray the character's personality and emotional states were a sight to see, and there was no one I would've rather casted for this role. I'm glad he won a golden globe for this movie, as he truly deserved it. Since everyone here did a great job, I'm just going to say props to the whole cast. I loved everyone from the protagonist, down to the supporting roles, and the acting in this movie really made it a great experience. There are plenty of big named actors who don't even play a big part in this movie, and all of them were standouts. 

When watching the trailer for this film, you'd expect it to be a more darker and grittier story, but in reality, this movie was actually pretty funny. The comedy is actually a big part of this movie, and it actually kept things light and enjoyable. There was a perfect blend between comedic relief and dramatic moments, which was perfect because it helped us, the audience, really feel like we were there with the characters. It felt like Watney always had something clever to say, which was great because it really created a positive tone within the movie. I really laughed throughout the movie, and it was actually a nice twist from your typical dark and depressing isolation movies. I think the message behind the comedy was to stay positive, even when times get tough, because if you do that, not only can you come out of the situation a better person, but you can really turn your life around for the better. 

Even though this movie was full of laughs, it was also full of intense and emotional moments. This movie manages to relay the severity of the situation to its viewers, but in the end, it really keeps a positive tone, and this movie is about something much more. This movie is about humanity, and the people on  this earth, and how when tragedy strikes one man or one nation, there is still something within us all to band together and help each other. Like Watney said in the trailer, when a natural disaster hits a nation, people from all around the world come together to send over medical supplies and rations. When one man is left on another planet millions of miles away, people from all around the world come together to support said human, throwing away any conflicts between them of any kind. This really shows that there's still humanity in this world, and to always have hope. The strong message of hope is definitely present here, and it is awe-inspiring. The film teaches you to have hope, even in the worst of situations, and that if you stay strong, everything will be okay in the end. 

So in the end, I truly loved ""The Martian"" and every aspect of it. This was one of the best movies of the year, and I would actually consider it to be in my top 10 movies of all time. I can say that this movie can make you happy and hopeful, even when there's not much to be hopeful about. In the end, this was a perfect film, and a perfect film deserves a perfect grade.",Chris O,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 08, 2016",Chris O,/user/id/972194187,RT,972194187,,The Martian

4.0,"Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said ""Yeah, that could actually work.""

Hints of the 1972 flick Silent Running with Bruce Dern which still keeps the viewer interested despite the fact he's the only actor for the bulk of screen time.

4.0,"""The Martian"" is the latest in the growing sub genre of high-quality sci-fi epics set in space. Is it as powerful as Interstellar? No, but it's a very enjoyable watch all the same.

Like ""Interstellar"", ""The Martian"" promotes the spirit of exploration, is directed by a respected British director (Ridley Scott was behind the camera for this film), and features Matt Damon and Jessica Chastian in Central roles. However, whilst ""Interstellar"" was an spectacular story centred around potential apocalypse and a father-daughter relationship, ""The Martian"" is a simpler movie, focusing on astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) working as a botanist on the Ares III project based on Mars. When a space storm strikes and the Ares III crew's is forced to evacuate the planet, Watney is wrongly presumed dead after an accident and left behind. With only the resources left when the Ares III base was abandoned, he tries to survive until help arrives. Jessica Chastian plays the leader of the Ares III crew, still stuck in space (other crew members are portrayed by Kate Mara, Sebastien Stan and Michael Pena), whilst the NASA staff on the ground are played by the likes of Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean. As both Ares III members and NASA staff communicate with Watney and work to rescue him, he experiences a number of triumphs and disasters trying to stay self-sufficient on the red planet.

Whilst ""Interstellar"" was focused on characters, ""The Martian"" places greater emphasis on celebrating the positive aspects of the human spirit, such as our tenacity, selflessness and will to survive. Even when things get sticky, Watney retains his resourcefulness and confident, snarky attitude, whilst the supporting cast are willing to take all sorts of risks in order to bring him home, even though this will take years. Also notable is use of all sorts of scientific and biological knowledge to create water and food. Though the technical jargon can be hard to follow, it all pertains to the situation and the refusal of anyone to give in. 

I would also like to take the opportunity to praise the soundtrack, which consists almost entirely of 70's classics. Even though Watney hates the songs and is only listening to them because there is no other music available, the use of tracks like ""Don't Leave Me This Way"", ""Starman"", ""Waterloo"" and ""I Will Survive"" ensures that ""The Martian"" features the most enjoyably on-the-nose selection of songs since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".

Overall, this was a very enjoyable film, owing as much to boys-own adventures such as ""Robinson Crusoe"" as it does to ""Interstellar"".",Raphael H,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Jan 04, 2016",Raphael H,/user/id/906353857,RT,906353857,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1193237708/picture,The Martian

4.5,"Words to describe this film is ""Ridley Scott + Sci-Fi = perfection"" As we know, Ridley Scott always does hit nor miss as a film maker. But when he does Sci-fi films, it will always be a nailer. And this proves why he's the best. The movie caught me by surprised in such many ways. I never thought it could be this fun and humorous. And you know, a film like this ends up in a very dramatic way I can sense it. A story that involves team work ends up pretty epic. This is one of those films that keep you on track and interested, A character driven story with great survival. Very fictional yet it could happened in real life. Wondering how would you survive in one planet, calculating the amount of sources you got. I really like the whole narrative thing as the main character talks about the situation and do something about it. Movie is clever too, it also shows how to handle pressure on certain situations that us viewers could also think about it. I love the cast, especially Matt Damon he deserves any accolades on this film. He's always a fantastic actor. An unusual Ridley Scott film, funny, intense and epic.

I also enjoyed that the film has an overly optimistic tone: that there really is no ""woe is me"" moment for Damon in that it seems like surviving is a totally workable task as opposed to some impossible odds.

4.5,"Ridley Scott directs one of the best films of the year and one of the best Sci-Fis I have seen in awhile. The Martian starring Matt Damon is based on the book written by Andy Weir. It's about a group of astronauts who are just finishing the mission on Mars, but when a ferocious storm hits, Damon is hit by debris, his crew assumes he is dead and leaves him behind. The Martian is fantastic. Great cast (Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wig), Damon gives one of his best performances since the Bourne series. Its crazy this isn't a true story because the movie made the situation feel so believable. The plot is so interesting and fascinating that it draws you in and doesn't want to make you leave. Every point in the movie is set up perfectly for the next. Nothing is out of place, no plot holes, it feels right. The movie is filled with beautiful cinematography, this is honestly one of the best looking films I have ever seen. Space looked great, Mars was amazing, even inside NASA. It's hard to keep your eyes of the screen. The film was also hilarious! A lot of quick one liners that are laugh out loud funny. A great finale, despite its long run time, The Martian's ending brings a satisfying ending and wraps up the film perfectly. The Martian is well written, exceptionally entertaining, and intelligent film. I loved this film so much and was so happy it was good. One of the best movie watching experiences this year.

The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.

The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film:

Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standard

2.5,Two movies. One very good(the first 1.15 of the movie) one very bad. The second part of course. Part one was a captivating story of survival pure and simple. I loved the ingenuity motivated by desperation and all the tension steadily growing because of this. Nicely portrayed by Damon which is no surprise. It seemed to the second half of the movie was hijacked by Hollywood. It shifted gears from a survival flick to a kind of international UN tale of feel goodery. Way to syrupy and hackneyed to anything close to interesting. Even getting China into the mix.

Grade:   A

In a Nutshell:    Why are audiences and critics raving about The Martian ?  Because it's fresh, suspenseful, inspiring, scientifically credible, and surprisingly funny. Director Ridley Scott takes us on a journey to the vast reaches of outer space and into the smallest corners of the human heart.

Based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, the movie includes stunning vistas, filmed on one of the largest sound stages in the world in Hungary.  Some of the scenes of Mars were also filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan. See it in 3D if you can.

The talented cast includes Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.


Uplifting Theme:
·         The film really focuses on optimism and hope, while astronaut/botanist Mark Watney is stranded on Mars.  Sure, Mark has his dark moments, but he quickly decides in the beginning ""I'm not going to die"" and that determination is what propels him to withstand the most difficult of situations on a hostile planet.
·         Human ingenuity is truly inspiring.  I know this is fiction, but still...
·         ""You just begin.  You solve one problem and then another."" - Mark

Things I liked:
·         NASA actually collaborated with the makers of The Martian , lending an authoritative air to the film, making it almost feel like a documentary.   If you want to learn more about the ARES space project and Ridley Scott's prologue series, go to www.areslive.com
·      Fun Disco music is one of the running gags throughout the movie.  At one point, Mark is so sick of listening to Disco music that he says ""No, I'm not going to turn the beat around.  I won't do it.""  The movie soundtrack will probably be pretty popular.  What music would YOU take if you were going to leave Earth on a long mission?
·         I loved the comment about the Council of Elrond directed at Sean Bean's character from The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring [HD] .
·         Jeff Daniels brings back his arrogant, bossy character from The Newsroom: Season 1 to play the Director of NASA.
·         I like it when directors give the audience a reason to keep watching during the credits at the end of a movie.
·         After many months of movies about superheroes who try to save the world, this refreshing flick is about the world trying to save one man.
·         The movie entertains your brain, as well as your heart, which beats fast during the last 20 minutes as you try to remember to breathe.
  -  Each time a new character is introduced in the movie, the audience sees a label on the screen, indicating the person's name and position, almost as if these are real people. 

Things I didn't like:
·         I know Saturday Night Live comedienne Kristin Wiig has done several serious films, but it's just still hard to take her seriously in a dramatic role.
·         If you got dizzy watching Gravity , there will be a few moments in this movie where you'll have to close your eyes.
·         Two F-bombs and some other profanity surprised me.  I thought PG-13 movies were only allowed to have 1 F-bomb, but somehow this movie gets away with two, plus a few other ""F"" moments that are mouthed silently.  In fact, Mark is told by NASA to clean up his language since everyone on Earth can read what he's saying on his transmissions.  As a result, his language gets worse and makes the audience laugh.

Funny lines:  
·         ""Luckily, I'm a botanist.  Mars will come to fear my Botany powers."" - Mark
·         ""I am the greatest botanist on this planet."" - Mark
·         ""I guess I colonized Mars.  In your face Neil Armstrong."" - Mark
·         ""So, yeah.  I blew myself up."" - Mark
·         ""I'm going to have to science the ""bleep"" out of this."" - Mark
·         ""I'm going to dip this potato in Vicodin and there's nobody who can stop me."" - Mark
·         ""I get to fly along like Iron Man."" - Mark

 

Things you learn in this movie about surviving on Mars:
·         Duct tape can fix everything.
·         You can use your own doodee to fertilize a garden.
-     Fire = bad.  Plutonium = good.
·         Science!

Tips for Parents:
·         Parents will like how educational the movie is.  Mark, the ""space pirate"" shows us how to problem-solve with impressive resourcefulness.
·         Some bloody moments.
·         Audiences see the entire back side of Matt Damon after he gets out of a shower.  He's the only human on an entire planet, so why use a towel?",Trina B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 28, 2015",Trina B,/user/id/793945371,RT,793945371,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/527012958/picture,The Martian

2.0,"At one point in The Martian, Matt Damon's character mentions that he hasn't bathed in quite a while. My wife said, ""He must stink!""
I replied, ""Almost as much as this movie.""

I've seen worst movies to be sure. But I would have expected more from director Ridley Scott and certainly a great deal more from one of the better known planets in our solar system.

Damon plays astro-botanist and electromechanical whiz Mark Whatney. This guy makes McGyver look like a five-year-old dealing with an incomplete Tinker Toy set.

I suspect that Mr. Scott, while screen testing Jessica Chastain, said something to the effect of, ""Yes! That's it! That's the kind of acting I want in this film! I want everyone to simper and smirk and give me that ""can-do"" attitude. We'll do over two hours of just that! As well, we'll pepper the film with crummy pop music from the seventies. And we'll have none of that four-letter language that I've used in my superior films such as American Gangster. This is going to be a movie that the whole family can suffer through!""

The effects are great. And although I haven't been there yet, the Mars landscape looks real enough. But this is typically oveblown Hollywood schmaltz (and you just KNOW how it's going to end).

I should finally mention another notable scene in this film where Damon is sitting in his Martian abode watching a video of a Happy Days episode. It raises the question, ""Would I rather be 225 million kilometers away on a cold and barren planet watching Happy Days, or subject myself to another movie like The Martian in the comfort of my living room?""

It's science fiction, but you are meant to believe the mundane stuff (like needing food, water and oxygen) but expected to believe some of the more absurd moments in the film.

4.0,"""The Martian"" is the kind of crowdpleaser that causes one to rejoice - not in the mood for underestimating audience intelligence or overdoing sentimentality, it is an attention-grabber of the ""Apollo 13,"" ""Gravity"" category, slightly concerned about its setting but not as much as it is with the textures and colors of its characters.  Surprising is how we don't question the fact that it is, basically, a shipwreck movie set on Mars; we are too consumed by its authentic drama and droll humor.  It feels like the first time in ages where a blockbuster's strengths have relied on its humanistic elements and not on its effects.  This is one of the best movies of the year.
	Matt Damon, an apparent successor to the Paul Newmans and Robert Redfords for most of his career, was born to play the role of astronaut Mark Watney, whose humility and unforced charm cogently match his own.  As the film opens, he is a part of a manned mission to Mars, which entails the study of the planet's 31 Sols, him as the ship's botanist.  The journey is cut short, though, when a massive storm derails anything by means of safety, forcing the troop to return to their orbiting vessel without Watney, who was hit by debris and is assumed dead.   
	Not so.  Hours later, he awakens, impaled in the stomach by an antenna and without much oxygen in his tank, but still very much alive.  Well aware that he has no contact with NASA or his crew, Watney maintains a cool exterior and works with what he has, which, luckily, includes a sizable amount of food and shelter stable enough to withhold Mars's harsh elements.  He calculates that his only chance of rescue will arrive in four years at the latest.  Fortunately, improvisation and quick-wit are characteristics that set Watney apart from his peers, and, before long, he is growing crops on the otherwise desolate planet.  Business keeps him away from a deep depression.
	But as ""The Martian"" is the crowdpleaser of the year, discovery of Watney's well-being auspiciously makes its way to NASA sooner than expected through satellite photographs.  Initially unsure of how to handle the situation (the agency quickly informs the nation of Watney's situation but leaves his crew in the dark for sake of them keeping level-heads on their journey back home), they soon begin the process of a rescue mission, which, despite being of utmost importance, is not necessarily an easy piece of planning.
	""The Martian"" is, arguably, the first optimistic, full-hearted, and naturalistically funny space movie to ever travel onto the screen.  Without the sharpened melodrama of its aforementioned rivals, its earnest predictability adds to its buoyancy and offhand diversion.  We sit at the edge of our seats, only this time the thrills stand next to comic undertones welcome in an otherwise self-serious genre.  Drew Goddard's screenplay is one of the best of the year, as easily able to conjure suspense as it is humor and proficient characterizations.
	Veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott directs with unsurprising steadiness - as an adaptable artist with a, more often than not, chameleonic sneakiness toward adjusting to different material (he's directed everything from ""Blade Runner"" to ""Thelma & Louise"" to ""Gladiator"" to ""American Gangster""), ""The Martian"" is among the finest additions to his oeuvre, visually stunning, genuinely human, and thoroughly likable.  The starry-eyed cast is as remarkably well-rounded, the tender Michael Peña, the perpetually nervous Mackenzie Scott, and the by-the-book but also empathetic Chastain being the standouts.
	""The Martian"" is warm and cerebral entertainment, better than most of what the Hollywood mainstream has given us this year.  Undoubtedly, it is a gem likely to emerge as a classic in later decades.  Everything about it - its direction, casting, and writing - is nearly immaculate.  You might want to see it again, not because you might have missed some details but because an experience so inviting is often a rare occasion in the cinema.",Blake P,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 26, 2015",Blake P,/user/id/909783806,RT,909783806,,The Martian

Also for taking one of the cast members of the Fantastic Four and actually sending her into outer space. Extra bonus points for having her married to The Winter Soldier. Not to mention giving Matt Damon's character from Interstellar a really interesting backstory.

However this is the kind of movie that lets the air out of my tires a bit. Ridley Scott who wonderfully directed Gladiator and Alien...is certainly skilled, yet he stretched out the movie for too long. I love the process of trying to survive in outer space...how could you do it? Well, you must have a brilliant mind to work it all out. There were moments when I thought there is just too many long moments on this red desert that looks like it was filmed in New Mexico with a red lens. Also the science does not always back up what you see in the film. No spoiler alert needed, but sometimes my need for a reality check would have been welcome. Yet this is an entertainment and certainly intelligently put together. Yet all the characters on Earth are stock characters that you would see in any B science fiction movie...and there is not emotional depth to the characters. How many scenes of people looking disappointed or waving their hands in the air as they cheer can we see? Apparently quite a few. It sounds like I did not like this picture...yet I remember Silent Running and I thrilled over the existential Gravity last year. Too many aspects of the film were derivative of other movies. And one last aspect. I hate a narrative that is constant. Silence is all right. Remember The Artist or perhaps Robert Redford's performance in All is Lost and lastly  2001 A Space Odyssey.

4.5,"Ridley Scott's The Martian (2015) is a return to form for one of our greatest directors (Alien, Blade Runner, etc.). Strong performances from an excellent cast (Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, etc.) propels the taut story about survival and rescuing an astronaut mistakenly left behind, which is ably supported by excellent production design/special effects in a realistic depiction of Mars exploration. In many ways, The Martian is a companion piece to last year's Gravity but it is starting to worry me that all of our best, least fantastical films about space exploration (Apollo 13, Gravity, The Martian) are about overcoming unmitigated disasters. It is understandable since films have to have a story and stories where everything goes right are boring but, nonetheless, it is troubling that Hollywood films are less about expressing the awesome wonders of realistically exploring space and more about channeling our fears about doing so even if, in the end, we overcome those fears to triumph over disaster.

4.0,"""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the greatest botanist on this planet.""

Ridley Scott's latest film, The Martian, is an intelligently crafted science fiction drama that takes on the form of a problem-solving movie in a very nerdy way. It is not an easy movie to sell considering it is very talkative and there is a lot of science involved, but Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel is quite captivating. There is no denying that the true star of the film is Matt Damon who basically manages to put on a one-man show in Mars and deliver a very entertaining performance in a similar way to what Tom Hanks did in Castaway. Although this film does give much more screen time to the characters back home as they try to communicate and find a way to bring their astronaut back, but it is Damon who really stands out. The film has been nominated for the Golden Globes for best comedy and although I don't agree with that designation it is Damon who delivers the comedy through his charismatic performance as he faces each new struggle in quite a light and positive way. The movie is a drama more than anything else and it carefully studies every scenario of what could go wrong in Mars and presents interesting solutions to those problems. Ultimately that is what makes this film stand out from other space films which Ridley himself has directed. This is a different kind of movie, a survival film with brains that respects its audience and doesn't try to include any fantastical elements for entertainment purposes (not that I have a problem with it since I was a huge fan of Prometheus, but this is a completely different genre).

Matt Damon gets all the credit for his charismatic performance as Mark Watney, the astronaut who is abandoned in Mars after a storm breaks out and his crew is forced to leave him behind, but the supporting cast is quite impressive as well. Jessica Chastain is Melissa Lewis, the astronaut in charge of the mission who has to make the fatal decision. The rest of the crew members are Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Chis Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). They don't get much screen time, but they are each given their moment and it is enough to know what motivates their decisions. I would've enjoyed to spend more time with these characters considering the cast is wonderful, but Matt Damon doesn't even give us time to miss them. The focus is on his character and he delivers every line to perfection. We are instantly drawn to his character and we identify with his struggle to survive. Back home at NASA headquarters we are also introduced to several characters who are doing the best they can to bring Mark home. Jeff Daniels is Teddy Sanders, the man responsible for any decision taken as the NASA director, Kristen Wiig is Annie Montrose, the director of Media Relations who is trying to save face in the midst of the situation, Sean Bean is Mitch Henderson, the flight director who is in contact with Watney's crew as they are returning home, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Vincent Kapoor, the mission director. It's surprising how Ridley Scott manages to include all these characters in the film and give them a unique personality as they all join forces to come up with the best solution. Daniels plays a very similar character to who he plays in The Newsroom, but if you only know him from Dumb and Dumber than you are in for a treat.   

When I first heard about this movie I was a bit worried about the effects that recent space films like Interstellar (which also starred Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain), Prometheus (which was directed by Ridley Scott), or Gravity might have on The Martian considering the space theme. To my surprise, the film stands out from the very opening scene as it takes a totally different approach and focuses more on Mark's survival skills and his wit. He is a very charismatic character who easily pulls you in to his conflict and allows you to participate in the problem-solution process. This isn't about special effects, it is about intelligent people getting together to come up with a solution.

5.0,"Where previously over-wrought space dramas like Gravity and Interstellar faltered, The Martian exists at the other end of the spectrum; crowd-pleasing, mostly feel-good drama with some well positioned lightness to the proceedings. It also represents a highly enjoyable return to form for director Ridley Scott.

The plot is uncomplicated; unfolding with minimal fuss but maximum sophistication, smarts without the condescension. Damon's Watney is the film's everyman; he has the ""science the shit out of this"" intellect combined with a down-to-Mars personality that anchors the film in all the right places. Damon effortlessly strikes the right balance of humility and confidence without the cockiness that usually creeps in here.

But what The Martian really excels at is providing yet another showcase for the ability of science-fiction to tell truly human stories without feeling like a science nerd. Damon and Scott both bring their A-game to the table to truly give this the broadest appeal without dumbing things down, and it's the result is an absolute triumph.",Jason S,False,True,False,False,5.0,"Dec 22, 2015",Jason S,/user/id/189126435,RT,189126435,,The Martian

3.0,"Critics have been praising The Martian, calling it the best film Ridley Scott has done in quite some time, that's a fair enough comment, however it doesn't stop it from being a reasonably timid and beige science fiction adventure all round.  When a team of astronauts are forced to evacuate a manned mission to Mars, botanist Mark Watney is injured and presumed dead, the crew set a return voyage to Earth and no one else is any the wiser. That is of course until Mark wakes up on the surface of Mars, with limited food and no form of communication. The Martian is essentially a survival romp, which to be brutally honest, could have spent more time with the survival aspect and less time trying to become everything its not. Scott is a visual genius, which is why many, including myself, got reasonably excited to see what he would do with our sibling planet. Sadly Mars is completely uninteresting and lacking any atmosphere or soul, The Martian never really looks special, it never stands out and if it werent for the constant reminder of the situation, you would be forgiven for forgetting your on another planet all together, that however is the least of this films worries. Scott manages to enlist an all star cast and its always welcoming to have a roster of this pedigree delivering lines, and that sadly is what is happening here, apart from Matt Damon, no one feels memorable or stand out, they just go through the motions. You cant blame the actors however as not only are they handed a pretty blase script from Drew Goddard, but Scott doesnt manage to ever focus in on a solid structure, leaving you miss the films saving grace when hes not on screen. Matt Damon is that saving grace, it should be his show and at times the film allows you to think that it is, having him pour his heart and soul out during video diaries and essential survival tasks, Scott continually loses all the effect Damon's work does to create character by thrusting through time at such a pace, the true test of Watney's struggles never latches on. It's a continual struggle for the viewers more than it should be, it appears to have a crisis of identity, its average at best to look at, Matt Damon doesnt get enough of our time and the film just spends far too much time hanging around areas we just dont care about. There are nice moments throughout its excessive run time, Watney's continual torment about the collection of disco music he has to keep him company, his determination to grow crops from martian soil and crafting a mode of communication with NASA is all very gripping and heart warming stuff, but just as we start to shine towards him, we are thrown back onto earth to talk technology for too long a time. The Martian is not a complete failure of a film, it has moments of heart and soul and Damon does a fine job trying to hold the film together. But it looks boring, its pacing is problematic and its run time is way too self indulgent.

4.5,"The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Donald Glover, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Pena and Kristen Wiig. The plot of the film is that the astronaut Mark Watney played by Matt Damon is stuck on mars, so Nasa which contains many of the actors above have to go and save him. Going into this film I was a little bit worried, due to Ridley Scott not being great at the moment, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised that this is one of the better films to come out in a while. Matt Damon gives one of the best performances of his entire career and its probably Oscar worthy, I'm not going to be able to talk about the entire supporting cast, although they are all great, but 2 stood out as being above the rest, which were Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover is showing that he can really act and in my opinion should have been Spiderman. The Martian is a wonderfully shot and directed film, one shot standing out would be when Matt Damon stands up and the camera goes a full circle around him to show how vast the landscape really is and it puts the audience the feeling of how big Mars is. Now when reading out the plot I can't help but smile, because the fact of the matter is Hollywood is getting boring and this one of the most original ideas in a long time, although films like Interstellar have tried to be original The Martian is better due to one giant matter and that is The Martian makes sense, seen as in Interstellar the characters will burst out a load of space stuff that very few audience members will understand, whereas in The Martian it keeps the writing simple so it doesn't matter who you are to enjoy this film.

5.0,"The Martian Review:
There are some movies you know going into them that they're going to be great. The Martian was not only great but exceeded all my expectations as well. A return to form from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) who directed last year's abysmal ""Exodus: Gods and Kings (which I adeptly gave 1/5 because I was happy that it ended), The Martian soars to the heights of a great space epic. In fact the thing that I loved about the Martian more than Alfonso Curon's ""Gravity"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is its optimism. Botanist Mark Watney played by an incredible Matt Damon, plays his character to a tee without depressing or alienating viewers. It is through this lens that we see plausible science (well somewhat plausible) succeed and the audience truly root for Mark Watney to be rescued by his Ares III crew creating a palpitating suspense during the rescue launch. That aside the supporting cast is impeccable, literally every single character feels important and is given enough screen-time to shine, from Jessica Chastain's Commander Lewis to Chitwetel Ejiofer's Vincent Kapoor. Also to be highly commended is the diversity of this cast- where every character is simply just equal- just the way it should be in every film.
Finally the cinematography and soundtrack is also used brilliantly with breathtaking visuals of the simmering sun making it's way below the mountaintops of Mars and a soundtrack that utilises Abba's ""Waterloo"" to great effect also scores some brownie points in my eyes.
All in all a fantastic film and so far my favourite film of 2015:

4.0,"Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat. True science has pissed in Ridley Scott's face. The Martian is about an astronaut who is left behind on Mars by a team that thinks him dead. He isn't. And now he is alone on an alien planet with dwindling food and oxygen resources. Where science screws the movie over is in NASA's recent announcement that there is evidence of water on the red planet. In The Martian, which mostly takes place there but was, I would assume, not filmed on location, there is no water or evidence of it, just rock and sand. Obviously when Ridley made the movie, we didn't know Mars had water, and by the time we found that out, the movie was in the can and ready to roll, leaving no time for a last minute addition to the plot. In fact, a major plot point in the film is the eponymous astronaut's efforts to grow food on a planet that has no water. 
So there you go, you've been warned. Don't go into this movie scoffing at the filmmaker's lack of scientific knowledge as some people have been doing. Cut them some slack. 

There seems to be a sub-genre gathering steam these last couple years. First we had vampires, then everything was zombies, now it seems Hollywood is preparing to beat to a pulp the person vs. space movie. You could even go so far as to say the sum of The Martian's parts is Gravity with a side of Interstellar. And while it doesn't achieve the visual elegance or pure spectacle of Gravity, or have the intelligence and scope of vision of Interstellar, it does feel like a worthy bedfellow. 

The Martian is based on a book, a book I didn't read. I don't read the book before the movie, I've explained this before, but the long and the short of it is I'd rather experience a story in a movie than on a page. Call me illiterate or unrefined, I can take it. I'm assuming much of the technical mumbo came from the book, rather than the (still very witty and smart) head of screenwriter Drew Goddard. In that case, my hat goes off to Andy Weir, who wrote it. The story has a lot of complicated (well, I found it complicated) scientific problems it needs to solve to keep Mark alive and get him home. I was impressed with its wit in this regard. I don't know how much of it is scientifically accurate in the real world, truthfully, I don't care. It worked for the film, so it worked for me. 

Matt Damon is very well cast as the poor fellow left alone on planet Mars. He carries much of the movie on his shoulders and if he wasn't up to the performance task, the movie would've failed. But this is Damon, he's proved himself capable of almost anything an audience could ask of him numerous times and he slides comfortably into the role of martian botanist Mark Watney. 
Back on earth, NASA is using its biggest brains to get Mark home. A parade of characters march through the film, each tasked with overcoming impossible obstacles and circumventing morale pummelling drawbacks. These characters are well acted, but some feel underwritten and provide the film with little more than a bridge to get from one arc or narrative beat to another (ahem, CNSA). 

I've been thinking about this movie a lot since I saw it. It's entertaining, it's gorgeously filmed (mostly on green screen I'm sure, but still), it's well acted and it has a lot of nice things to say about our planet's ability to unite under a given cause. And while the plot is very much the three act structure, with all the climaxes and obstacles in all the proper places, and it has more supporting characters than it can keep track of, it's still a good story and a fun adventure. I give it a hearty four stars and wait patiently for the next human vs. space movie to come rolling down the red carpet.

4.0,"Ridley Scott hasnt been in his best form for a few years now (Prometheus, The Counsellor, Exodus: Gods and Kings) so I did go into The Martian a tad nervous but nonetheless rooting for him as much as I was for his stranded hero. For a while, Ridles delivers and the film is tense, exciting, amusing, and credible - everything you hoped for when you decided to cough up the extra bucks for the plastic specs. But before long, slick, intelligent and contemporary hurtles into lazy, predictable and 90s.

Scott is brilliant at creating authentic worlds and, no stranger to space, he has again imbued the realm of The Martian with a true sense of believability - the planet, the science, the engineering, the innumerable obstacles etc. The design of all things space is sexy; beautiful and credibly functional. The NASA space command center is suitably grand, high-tech and well populated with extras. Everything else about Earth, however, is sadly two-dimensional.

The Martian is pretty much Cast Away on the Red Planet without the depth of existential interrogation. Like Tom Hanks, Matt Damon is perfect in the lead role. Before botanist/astronaut Mark Watney has even opened his mouth, were totally with him. Its Matt Damon. Who doesnt like Matt Damon? Unlike other stars, Matt keeps his private life private so we all believe he is the funny, smart, strong, good-guy he plays on screen and this role totally exploits every inch of that persona. But that also presents a challenge for the film: how do you maintain tension when everyone knows youre not going to kill off such a likeable, capable hero? Sorry, Spoiler Alert!

This dilemma extends beyond the central protagonist because if the concept is an everyman survives against incredible odds because of his incredible guts and ingenuity it implies that no one else can die attempting to rescue him either. If they did, itd be a Phyrric victory.

Of course, plot endings are almost invariably known when we walk into a cinema and thats just fine as long as the writer and director make you question your prediction and/or make you care more about the protagonists evolution rather than his achievement. Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard regrettably do neither.

Thin is the order of the day when it comes to character development. Sure, Mark Watney is charming, courageous and super smart, but who is he really? He has parents but clearly no partner or kids. Why not? Hes clearly in his 40s. Were not even given the sense that hes married to his work or that hes sacrificed a personal life for career. Granted, its refreshing that he doesnt have some beautiful wife and toddler back home anxiously hanging on every nail-biting development but perhaps if there was a scene where, in the face of death, he regretted a love hed lost or never embraced we wouldve had another level on which to care about him and his inevitable return home.

Im guessing the beautiful and talented Jessica Chastain wanted to pull on a space suit after remaining on Earth in Interstellar but she really shouldve waited for a better role. Like Watney, she plays a brave and capable type but her only character distinction is limited to a maligned penchant for disco and ABBA. Jeff Daniels gives a look-no-hands! performance as Teddy Sanders, Director of NASA. Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Peña and Sean Bean are similarly wasted in dull roles but I felt genuinely embarrassed for Kristen Wiig as NASAs publicist.

Her dialogue is bad exposition and watching her participate in the cheesy climax of hugs, high-fives and You-done-good-kid nods stretching from Times Square to Red Square via Leicester was painful. I swear in her eyes I could read, Just think of the money Kris. Think of the money. The Money. The Money I mean, seriously, its 2015. Are we still doing that around-the-world-we-come-together-to celebrate shit? And if so, where were the Aussies jumping up and down at the Opera House?

Kristen Wiig is at a point in her career where she shouldve played the lead in this film. It wouldve been that much more interesting. But apart from Jessica Chastain, pretty much all the female characters were subordinates to males. Has Ridles forgotten Sigourney Weavers Ripley?

Another aspect of The Martian that feels somewhat anachronistic is the man-in-space effect. Scenes of people floating around, gulping droplets of water, or being jerked to rude halt by a cord tethered to a space craft are old hat now. Weve been there done that better with Sandra. And Im gonna put it out there and say that I dont think 3D is all that. The colours are muted, the image is dark and todays 3D effects no more convince me of being right there than Alf Sillimans 1969 criminally underrated classic The Stewardesses made me believe I was in their motel room binging on sex and acid.

Having said all that, would I recommend The Martian? Sure. Its still a mostly enjoyable ride, even if we have been on it a few times before. Lets just pray that Scott is saving his best for the next instalment in the Alien franchise: Alien: Paradise Lost. Id hate for it to be the Terminator Genisys of the Alien series, further sullying the reputation of Scotts original, near-perfect space thriller.",David H,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 16, 2015",David H,/user/id/972591707,RT,972591707,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153865930780160/picture,The Martian

3.0,"An astronaut/botanist is stranded on Mars and must rely upon ingenuity to survive.
It's hard to divorce my opinions about this film from my opinions of the book, for after the film I thought that they had adapted the book but left out all the good parts. The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one ""fuck"" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 ""fucks""). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to ""science the shit out of,"" all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed.

4.0,"**** Good
Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" is pretty much a marginally great movie, but I would rather insert it in the ""marginally really good movie"" category. This sci-fi light comedy focuses on astronaut Mark Watney. Poor Mark was left for dead in Mars by his fellow astronaut crew members when a mission to Mars had an accidental explosion. However, NASA eventually found a mark that revealed that Mark is really alive, and now their challenger, I mean challenging mission is to bring Mark back safely. A good chunk of ""The Martian"" resembles the ""Castaway"" makeup: a man stranded alone and fighting for not just physical survival but psychological survival; differences: one is an island, and the other one is in a planet, and also one talks to a volleyball named Wilson, and the other one talks to a video screen named... wait Mark did not give the video screen a name, maybe he should have called it Screenie. Anyways, Scott's directorial vision is out-of- this-world and is deservant of Best Director nomination love; it really moved me how he was able to incorporate disco music in a sci-fi flick. Drew Goddard's screenplay worked on the comedic fare, but lost me a bit with the way-too-much scientific technical verbose. Matt Damon was excellent as Watney. The supporting acting was also not spaced-out in acting proficiency; which included outstanding work from Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, and Sean Bean.

4.0,"The annual big budget space movie.  So this is about a team of astronauts that go to Mars on a research trip.  After an accident in a giant storm, a botanist by the name of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets left behind for dead.  The rest of his team is already going back to Earth, but it turns out that he is actually still alive, and has to figure out what exactly he is going to do as he is the only man living on Mars.  I thought this looked pretty good, but it wasn't something I was actively excited about.  But then the reviews started to roll in, and this has gained so much traction that there are even rumbling of this getting a Best Picture nomination.  While I'm not necessarily drinking the Kool-Aid to that extent, I will say they've made a film that is very worthy of your time.  As of yesterday, this just got a Best Picture nomination for Best Musical or Comedy... I don't know if there was a song or tap dance that I missed, but I have no idea what they're talking about.  There are good moments of comedic relief to break up tension, but that is about it.  That is one of the good points about it is, though; while almost anybody else put in this man's shoes would give up (and you wouldn't blame them, either), Watney has moxie, and the way he stays lighthearted given the gravity of his situation is an element that allows you to form a tangible connection with him.  He's also extremely resourceful, and he is able to make excellent use of the limited amount of items that he has at his disposal.  Another thing this film does well is the science of it all; it's not like this is incredibly tight or anything, but they never breach the realm of being unbelievable.  It's the Jurassic Park effect; by keeping the science simple and not trying to gloss over everything with some technical mumbo jumbo, it manages to dumb it down without being getting stupid, which allows you to buy into it more.  To expand upon a previous sentiment, I liked this a lot, but it's going to be low on my best of the year list if it makes it at all (and I usually do somewhere around a top 25 - 30).  It's well paced, and it's a really good story.  There's not a thing about this that you don't buy, and Matt Damon does great at selling this because he's a quality leading man.  That said, this was sold to me as a potential ""movie of the year"" and I never thought of this as that at any point during the runtime.  I don't think this is groundbreaking, and in fact, I think this is very straightforward, and it plays out how you think it will almost to a fault.  Still predictability isn't necessarily a deal breaker, and this has way more good in it than bad.  One thing I am more than okay with is having one of these giant blockbuster space movies every year, and between the success of this, Interstellar and Gravity, I am looking forward to seeing more of these movies for years to come.",John M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 11, 2015",John M,/user/id/782214838,RT,782214838,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/25106477/picture,The Martian

4.0,"Ridley Scott must love space! After Alien and Prometheus, he has now brought another visually stunning space adventure to the big screen. The Martian tells the story of Mark Watney (a very solid Matt Damon) who's left for dead on Mars after his team has to abort their Ares III mission on the red planet due to an extremely heavy storm, his inventive struggle for survival and the rescue mission(s) that are set up to get him home alive.
It's become an interesting cross-over between geekish science-fest and sci-fi action, with the science actually coming across as very realistic (even though the events aren't) and the action being relatively low-key. And that's what actually works here... Over the top action would've entirely overshadowed the story of Mark Watney's deprevation during his +500 days on Mars.
Scott has delivered a film with room for action, tension, excitement, drama, character development (What does it do to a man to be alone for so many days? What does it do to the teamleader to decide to leave him behind?) and a vehicle for some good performances, especially Damon and Chastain.

It was in an initial rocket launch from Mars, when he had to put his faith entirely in the hands of intelligent, capable people. That is exactly how I felt when watching The Martian. I did not feel engaged as an audience member. Simply watching. Thankfully, what I was watching was pretty entertaining: Matt Damon keeping his sense of humour alive in a state of incredible isolation, and he and everyone else in the movie trading science wisdom all around, hoping the audience nods and moves along.

4.0,"Loved the movie but a couple of things kept me from giving it a 5 star rating.  First, the pros:  Obviously it was visually stunning.  The Hab, Rover, MAV and Hermes all came to life for me.  Matt Damon was a perfect Mark Watney.  There was a technicality and humor in the book that (while wonderful) didn't let a lot of the rawer emotions through.  The pain, fear and overwhelming desolation that Watney (at times) should have been emoting in the book really came clear in the film.  Kate Mara (Johansen) and Michael Pena (Martinez) did great jobs as well.  
Now the cons:  Jessica Chastain's acting and portrayal of Commander Lewis just fell flat for me.  Actually I'll amend that to say that her character, as written, was off.  The book portrayed a confident, thoughtful and capable commander who knew her team's abilities and trusted them to do their jobs (in regard to the rescue attempt scene).  Instead, what we saw was the Commander leap out of her seat and arrogantly tell the teams EVA specialist to not perform an EVA so she can go outside and grab Watney herself thus selfishly erasing her personal guilt about giving the order to leave him behind (which was the correct decision anyway).  
And Mitch Henderson!  In the book, he was a no-nonsense, egotistical, self-righteous jerk who didn't give a crap what people thought of him, knew his stuff and was fiercely dedicated to keeping the crew informed and getting them home.  The movie turned him into a simpering, whining, morose man who just kept moaning ""we should tell the crew..."".  He looked enough like a whipped puppy that I wanted Teddy to whack him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper.

5.0,"Over the years Ridley Scott has been responsible for some major achievements in cinema (e.g. Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator). Recently he has created some forgettable films (The Counselor, Exodus: Gods and Kings). Now he takes on the film adaption of Andy Weir's 2011 novel The Martian. With the support of an all-star cast and thrilling plot, Scott has once again achieved greatness. 
The Martian follows astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is stranded on Mars after being presumed dead by his crew mates. Watney must ""science the shit out of"" his situation in order to survive. Luckily he is a botanist. Back at Earth, NASA is hard at work in getting back Watney safe and alive. Through the news, the whole world is able to stay connected to Watney's story. As the viewer, we are able to witness the everyday struggles of Watney on Mars and NASA on Earth. The film puts the viewer right in the middle of the events taken place. Although Watney may be alone on Mars, movie goers will feel like they are accompanying him during his stay. The film only slightly stumbles during scenes that were intended to be intense. Particularly the scenes involving the crew. The scenes seemed a bit rushed, lacking build-up.
Unlike many space films, The Martian does not have some underlying deep message. It is a rescue film. It's simplicity is what makes the film work so well. The film is thrilling, but features very humorous dialog. Mars may have taken away years of living on Earth, but his humor remains intact. Watney is a man you root for. Many people in his situation would give up, but Watney has the will to live. He becomes a symbol of the ""no man left behind"" motivation that fuels NASA just as much as actually fuel. For a film with a run length of two hours and twenty-two minutes, I can honestly say I was entertained every minute. Not sure if Watney can say the same about his time on Mars (but disco music must help kill time right?).

4.0,"With the recent news that NASA have discovered water on the surface of Mars, it seems like a great coincidence that a film set almost 100% on Mars chronicling a humanâ??s ability to survive out there on its terrain came out a week after NASAâ??s announcement. It appears to be more and more likely that life can exist on Mars, especially with Hollywood star Matt Damon advertising how itâ??s done using science and human know-how. But this coincidence could quite simply have been because American novelist Andy Weirâ??s The Martian was just too brilliant not to make! Up to you to choose, but all we really need to know is that Mars, our neighbouring planet, is hot topic right now, especially with the imminent Mars One missions to form a colony of humans projected for 2027, so The Martian has been hotly anticipated and it is safe to say adds fuel to letâ??s-go-to-Marsâ?? fire.
 
The Martian is a well balanced film that gives us just about enough from each characterâ??s perspective of the situation, whether it is Watneyâ??s time on Mars, the Ares III spaceship that left Watney for dead, or NASAâ??s rescue procedures on Earth, the film makes sure we get an understanding of the scale of the story. Yes at times there are too many needless scientists, Kristen Wiig Iâ??m looking at you, but The Martian prides itself on its intricate scientific detailing, something Weir strove to realise, therefore The Martian has to go over each scientific detail in detail, which in turn reduces the filmâ??s suspenseful impact, because there is a realism to everything we canâ??t help but watch with interest rather than awe. The Martian prefers to focus heavily on the science of things, seeing as the story is almost a reality for us, but it misses the trick space epic Interstellar achieves, which is to entrench us in the emotional side of being stranded alone years from safety; a ploy that would comprehend the psychological trappings of such an event. Interstellar is emotionally deep and intense at times, likewise with Gravity that shows you can produce heartfelt emotion with just one person, but The Martian doesnâ??t even prickle the thresholds of terror when stranded in the vastness of space, so although downright thrilling, it cannot grip us to the point of emotional conquering. The Martian is a story of proving humanityâ??s survival on another planet, not a conquering of personal demons so it cannot extend itself that far into the emotional spectrum, but we appreciate it for what it offers which is a rollercoaster ride of survival on Mars, something we can actually hope of doing one day, so science is the way.
 
It is swift riding for Watney a lot of time, who it seems is rewarded a lot more than put at risk, subliminally insinuating that Mars is safe for humans. Safe or not, Watneyâ??s reliance on comedy helps in diminishing the gripping atmosphere the situation evokes. Watneyâ??s comic nature is a balance between hit and misses, because sometimes he can be truly funny, but on others you question whether that is the right human reaction to the situation. There is a lack of emotion towards what he actually goes through, because he just appears too optimistic and unruffled despite being the only person on a desolate planet 3 years away from safety. He records a diary log numerous times throughout a day, essentially talking to himself, which could drive him mental, not to mention his do-or-die situation, yet Watney appears unfazed by all of this, talking to himself for 561 sols (Martian days), the equivalent of just under 2 years roughly, and the feeble attempt at showing his psychological despair results in Damon having to grow his hair and beard Cast Away style. Another thing is that everyone seems to have a family except for Watney, who seems to be as alone in his life as he is on Mars. His family in this case is the world, who have been watching his quest for survival through the thousands of news reports and live recordings of his desolation. Watney is a dry character in all honesty, but Damonâ??s sheer resilience and comic aptitude are enough to quell any resentment for his lack of depth.
 
Mars seems like a nice place if you have a spacesuit, permanent home and rover, because the gravelly winds and freezing temperatures arenâ??t at all a barrier unless you go outside. And when you go outside, Wadi Rum of Jordan, as it has been for sci-fi films of the past, renders the rocky slopes and ginger terrain as absolutely beautiful. But the climax brings the best out of The Martianâ??s visuals as it culminates on the fringes of Mars, with the great, orange ball lurking in the background of the frame. This is when The Martian resumes normal cinematic duties and shifts our interest into awe mode. Its conclusion is heavily influenced by sci-fi features of the last few years, with Gravity going hand in hand with The Martian on so many elements, from being stranded alone, in space, to having to find a way to return home. But fuelling a mixture of Iron Man and Gravity at the end, The Martian is given the cinematic climax it deserves, producing a thrilling, rip-roaring, must-defy-all-limits-of-science culmination to something that prided itself on being scientifically accurate. It is rather a quixotic finale, but you will love it!
 
After all, The Martian is a story of survival, this time on Mars. From the navigation of Mars using a rover, to making potatoes with your own shit, the creation of water and the recharging of batteries using solar panels, The Martian is blatantly trying to prove human ingenuity can defeat any obstacle. Matt Damon is integral in this process, giving a strong solo performance of a man alone, striving to survive using his knack for science. Chiwetel Ejioforâ??s engineer stands out with a strong performance, as does Jeff Danielsâ?? director of NASA, but plenty of big stars are underused, especially Jessica Chastainâ??s Captain Lewis, so Damon has to dominate a lot of the running time with banter and science, something that grows wearisome for a good 20 minutes midway through the film. Truthfully, a bit more time with these folks would have solved this blip for The Martian, but the dogged intricacy of its science removes space for a lot of things, including a psychological investigation of Watneyâ??s character, which seems to be an obvious void. But after all, The Martian is very much an advertisement that us humans can survive out on Mars, and Damon will be the figure that shows us how itâ??s done, inspiring youngâ??uns into a career of engineering with an out of this world spectacle.
 
The Verdict:
 
A blatant advertisement for life on mars, The Martian is so scientifically intricate that the endingâ??s thrilling appeal will leave you dumbstruck with awe.

4.5,"This is certainly one of the best films I have seen this year. It is such a great space movie, doing a better job of what ""Gravity"" from 2012 and even 2014's ""Interstellar"" wanted to accomplish. It is a fantastic thriller, drawing you in with a suspenseful countdown to disaster, but it is also surprisingly funny, with a lot of great jokes to break up the tension. Everyone in the film offers incredible performances that sink deeply into the roles, with special mentions to Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, of course. It is also really cool to not only watch these characters solve and think about their problems, but we as an audience actually get to see how they go about completing those tasks. Although I have some minor nitpicks that bother me when they pop up within the film (""How come we don't see Mark Wattney's family and their reaction to his predicament?;"" man, the crew of the ""Hermes"" really seem to take this situation, and the fact that they left their supposedly-dead-but-not-really friend behind, calmly), but the movie is still worth watching and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a truly grand space adventure to sit alongside ""2001: a Space Odyssey.""",Joshua M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 27, 2015",Joshua M,/user/id/815041059,RT,815041059,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1073213829/picture,The Martian

4.0,"I found myself surprised when I realized how long The Martian was. At almost two and a half hours, The Martian does a great job of keeping you interested for the entirety of the lengthy flick. I found myself only realizing its length after the last shot and checking my watch. Scott accomplishes a lot with his pacing in this film. A formula of ""Exposition - Execution - Crisis - Resolution,"" does wonders for the experience. The story is furthered seamlessly, we grow quintessential to love and care about our Characters, we laugh and cry. While all of this makes for a pleasurable experience, it certainly cannot be said that The Marian is innovative. With his story arc, message, and characters laid out for him from the get go, Scott decides to play his cards close to the chest. Even down to his signature introduction, The Martian makes it clear that Scott believes himself to have a personal formula down for consistent filmmaking: The Martian seems like a signature film more than anything else. Scott plays to what he knows he can do and it pays off for a film that is worth the see, especially for Sci-Fi, NASA, and Survival lovers.

An all around satisfying film, The Martian will never leave you with a lack of beautiful, red and mountain-filled panorama shots to gape at for a few seconds, as well as a phenomenal use of space to not make the audience claustrophobic in tight spaces. With contenders such as Interstellar and Gravity to compete with on the space aspect, Scott puts his stock instead into his writing and landscape shots. It's simply beautiful.

The Martian's script is a well crafted, feel good story of hope and ingenuity. Damon's exposition through the use of Log Entries gives a creative way to further the plot, and develop his character.  Humor is used effectively to ""spice up"" tech talk that gets exhausting quickly. Well placed jokes relieve tension and humanize NASA, which is portrayed with a high amount of respect in the film. A refreshing, pro-government agency view for a mainstream movie is welcomed in this story. Matt Damon gives a likable and talented performance as Mark Watney: The Genius Who Fucks Everything Up And Still Lives. Though vaguely disappointed in the lack of his death, Sean Bean gives what can be called the quintessential performance of this film: believable, but undoubtedly forgettable. I was pleasantly surprised by Donald Glover's (AKA Rapper Childish Gambino) casting in this film, and he did a superb job in his role.

For those who read the novel it was based on, you will most likely find yourself incredibly pleased with it's continuity to the book up until the last 15 minutes. For some reason or another, the script adds little to no ""outside the book"" material to the film up until the last few minutes. As such, the ending is naturally riddles with out-of-place, overly-hollywoodized logic holes and scientific errors. While Watney ""Iron Man"" flying through the air is fun, it feels out of place in a film that has tried to stay true to practical science for the rest of the film. Luckily, this last portion of uncomfortable writing is followed by a spectacular ending to the film, with Watney's last bit of exposition tying up the film.",Houston W,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 27, 2015",Houston W,/user/id/968721273,RT,968721273,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002816166355/picture,The Martian
4.0,"As a book, The Martian serves to show just how amazing it is for one human being to overcome the obstacles of an entire planet against him and the movie, though heavily condensed, does the same. From the very beginning, audiences are forced to watch as Mark painstakingly must dig metal from his skin and then staple up the wound. This scene lasts a very long time for those who are squeamish and it ends with him only being able to look around at the empty Mar base around him. As the movie goes on, we get to continue to see amazing CGI of the planet and, of course, many, many different angles of the same white tent that Mark is forced to spend most of his time in. Mark communicates to us through his journal at on several occasions talking to himself. While this does leave a little bit of dissatisfaction to exactly what is going on in Mark's mind, the on point expressions of Matt Damon are a big help. A crowning jewel to this movie was the time spent on Earth as NASA attempts to recover from the blow that accidentally leaving an astronaut stranded on Mars can unfortunately cause. The actors do great jobs at  embracing their characters and how their characters are forced to react as the situation changes. And believe me, do the situations in this movie change.

4.5,"Overall I thought the movie was great, thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been on bad terms with Ridley Scott ever since Prometheus, but my faith in him has been fully restored. The Martin is an intelligent, funny, gripping and often poignant celebration of humanity ingenuity and perseverance in the face of all the odds. This might sound very familiar, and in fact one of the movies principle drawbacks is that this kind of ground has been covered extensively. We've seen stories, many of them based on true events, of individuals who found themselves face to face with death and, of course, fought tooth and nail to survive. 127 Hours, Touching The Void, Cast Away, Apollo 13, Gravity, the list goes on. But that's not to say that every single one is the same, and that something new can't be brought to the table, and happily The Martian does just that. Our central character is likable and engaging, and the movie does an effective job of putting us in his shoes, allowing us to assist in aiding in his struggle. The planet Mars is made to look not like a completely barren wasteland, but almost like the site of a former civilisation, with the giant rocky structures resembling ancient, timeworn buildings. We don't spend much time in space, but when we do we're given the sensation of not soaring, but floating through it. One scene in particular contains a sneaky homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which I think all modern sci-fi movies are required by law to include.
Anything bad I have to say about the film is honestly just nit-picking. If you're looking for action, it does have its moments, but not nearly enough to satisfy the Bay crowd.

The film opens with Mark Watney, who was the character Damon was born for and waiting to play for all of his life, being stranded on Mars after his crew are forced to abandon him during a wind storm. 
An aspect I love about Scott's movies is that while you'd assume the film would be a ''boy's movie'', he makes it open for all genders, which really makes a difference. 
The characters in this movie were perfectly casted and performed, and the cinematography was well done. Also, I thought the film had an impressive soundtrack, myself.

4.0,"I've often cited the old saying that good books tend to turn into disappointing movies while mediocre books often turn into excellent films. Meet ""The Martian"".

The novel of the same name was originally self-published online by author Andy Weir, and the chapter-by-chapter released story turned into a word of mouth event and ultimately got turned into a bestselling book.

I found Weir's book technically fascinating and at times quite funny, but not a fully formed novel, so flat was the language and haphazard the structure. Yet screenwriter Drew Goddard has adapted the Weir's work extremely faithfully into a script that comes alive as an excellent film in the hands of legendary if quite uneven director Ridley Scott.

The story is about Mark Watney, a lone astronaut who is assumed dead in a Martian sand storm by his crewmates and left to survive alone on the red planet, making things up as he goes as he must make do with insufficient resources. In the book I was especially put off by the narration of the astronaut, which was nicely witty and nerdy, but never became the voice of a real person. There's a lot of that narration in the movie as well in the form of video reports. Lead Matt Damon spends a fair amount of time looking at a camera, going through the monologue.

I found the best parts of the novel to be the humor, although there was too much hit-and-miss there, and the technical aspects, which are what I think Weir was intentionally focusing on. Both have been reduced in the script in order to give way to what was sadly missing from the book: a sense of wonder and humanity.

Scott gives us beautiful Martian vistas where he has inserted tiny Watney. Detailed, personal space coexists with grand, eternal space. This alone has been done with such vision it grands the story depth lacking in the text, which showcases the universe merely as a problem solving exercise. Scott gives us the endless, humbling dimensions of it all with the tools of cinema he has at his disposal. The small and the grand fit together seamlessly. A delightful disco soundtrack (!) gives some retro aesthetics a perfect boost.

We also get a solid cast that does well with very little. I would have hoped they'd have gotten someone with more charisma to play Watney who is still left too thin, but Damon is adequate in animating Watney's inner life with means not found in the dialogue. I'm a big admirer of Jessica Chastain and again- just as in very recent ""Crimson Peak""- she outshines a more central character who has better lines by pouring all of her presence into a vaguely written role. She plays the mission leader who left Watney behind, a character full of potential completely looked over in the source material.

I had quips about the whole humanity-unites-to-save-one-man-no-matter-the-cost -romanticism of the novel, and that all is still present in Scott's version. It is the one thing that breaks an otherwise completely competent mold of the film, but doesn't manage to do all that much damage. So realistic, heartfelt yet epic the picture is.",Mikael K,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 25, 2015",Mikael K,/user/id/822954353,RT,822954353,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1099868060/picture,The Martian

4.0,"A return to form for director Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" opened on Oct. 2 to overwhelming critical and commercial success. The opening weekend box office for the film was $55 million, on par with the success of ""Gravity"" in 2013.

Adapted from Andy Weir's novel of the same name, ""The Martian"" details the time spent of astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) on the red planet after he is abandoned and presumed dead. Alone on an unknown world, Watney discovers the strength needed to survive while the human race comes together to bring him home. 

One of the first things that struck me upon exiting the theater was just how uplifting the film was at times. It is easy to imagine a film about isolation being bleak, but the collaboration between Weir and screenwriter Drew Goddard made for a surprisingly fun and comedic film. 

With a film that is essentially an updated version of ""Cast Away,"" there is obviously going to be a lot of time spent alone with the main character. Damon tends to be a hit or miss actor. He has been great in the works like ""The Departed"" and the Bourne franchise, but the last time he was in a science-fiction film, ""Interstellar,"" he was one of the weakest aspects of the movie. Here, however, his charismatic performance brought the scenes on Mars to life and made the movie a pleasure to watch. He also handled the more intense dramatic sequences, particularly a surgery scene early in the film, with a cool dignity. 

Speaking of hit or miss, this is Scott's first film since ""American Gangster"" in 2007 to be a solid critical success around the board, excluding ""Prometheus,"" which was hailed by some and booed by others. It is well deserving of its Rotten Tomato score of 93%, as Scott brought the Martian landscape to life with impressive visuals and several intense sequences. The jaw dropping finale of the film left my palms sweaty and my popcorn bucket empty. 

Although a lot of the film is spent on Mars, there is a large portion centered on Earth-based characters, which brings me to my one major criticism. None of the supporting cast members gave bad performances per se, but the list of secondary characters was a bit too extensive to be handled correctly. I understand that that the characters were pulled straight from the book, but as an adaptation, some elements became superfluous. It became a bit excessive when the film was halfway through its runtime and still introducing characters. Several of the scientist characters could have been condensed into a single, better fleshed out character instead of several whose names I don't remember. I'm still not sure what Kristen Wiig was doing in this movie. 

The film also had a minor pacing issue when it came to some of the Earth scenes. It has been rumored that Goddard was contractually obligated by NASA to include certain scenes and lines of dialogue. I can neither confirm nor deny the validity of this, but I would be able to understand if it were true, seeing as a 20 minute scene on Earth dropped the ball for a little while. 

This is easily forgiven and forgotten however when considering just how smart and well-crafted the film is on the whole.

I was quite sad that all the ""tense"" moments never felt tense. There seemed to be no obstacle too great as most of the problems were easily solved and there were very few setbacks. It's not that I wanted an unhappy ending, I just would have liked to have some concern that things weren't going to end well. I never worried that they wouldn't save him and I felt like that was a bad thing. 

My other problem was it seemed that Jessica Chastain's character had very little emotion about leaving him behind and it would have been nice to have a scene where she wasn't so in control and had this gut wrenching guilt, it would have made her more realistic and likeable.

4.5,"So I'll try to keep my reviews a little bit shorter.  The Martian is very well directed from the work of Ridley Scott.  The cinematography of Damon on Mars is remarkable and it will make you feel as if you truly were on Mars.  Matt Damon is acting his ass off and that's what's required when most of a movie is dependent on one character.  The supporting characters back on Earth were great too with emphasis on Jeff Daniels.  Daniels, being the director of NASA has no easy task either as people in those positions of power are a focus any time - any day and have to make those difficult decisions.

Based on a novel ""in which I didn't read"" but heard great things about. I also heard the the novelist did the research and made sure that most, if not all all things in the book were scientifically sound.  The writing was well done and that showed through the dialogue.  This was a long movie of over 2 hours, but didn't seem that long because the pacing was on target.

Even though ""The Martian"" is more of an adventure/suspense/sci-fi film, it has a decent amount of humor - mainly from Damon.  That's what make it so interesting, is that the only character in a real dilemma in this movie is the only one who is showing humor.  There is a lot of science and math in the film and if you're into that and understand it, then you'll be pleased as the most of us will take it for what it is and forget it after we hear or see it.  The Martian is a great movie and I won't be surprised if there are some nominations later on.  It's definitely re-watchable over and over again and I highly recommend that you watch it.

I rated it as a 4.5/5!  I did have a couple dislikes about the movie and there are a few scenes and or elements that seemed like there were added in or they happened just too conveniently.  I will also say that near the end is another hiccup that made me think - ""well I'm not too sure about that."" but it worked for what it was - a movie.  I like it nonetheless.

As always, watch it and let me know what you think about it as I'll never tell you to ""not watch"" any movie that's out there. Enjoy!

5.0,"Ridley Scott may of had some harsh criticism for many of his films as of late. 'The Martian' based on Andy Weir's best selling sci-fi novel however, surpassed my expectations by a long mile. This incredibly polished, fast-paced, smart and evocative film may be one of the most finest ever films Ridley Scott has ever directed. While it's hard to ignore what Hollywood has been trying to do with Matt Damon being a victim in both 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Interstellar' and now this, Damon is almost pretty much a one man show throughout his character's entire arc to survive on a planet where nothing grows and many of his circumstantial nature can be fatal. The plot takes viewers on such a thoughtful, exciting, thrilling and touching ride, it's hard to not be invested with every character at play whether on earth or in space. In saying that, the film also offers several different types of moods whether it it be dramatic, thrilling or hilarious it's almost the biggest pieces of requirement for every great film script. Last but not least every other cast member on board this film is just as much a fine performer invested in their character within every moment of the film.

3.5,"The film is NOT called Bring Him Home in case you were wondering. 78 year old Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, the genre he is best known for (Alien/Blade Runner/Prometheus). Though this scifi is much more based on real world science of the near future (2030) than the aforementioned movies. The book on which it's based got a lot of critical acclaim but I didn't read it so I can't say how well the story made the translation to the big screen. The Martian is a rather uplifting -yes dare I say feel good- film despite the apparently grim fate that befalls Mark Whatley (the astronaut stranded on Mars played by Matt Damon). You could say it's a testament to the resourcefulness of humans in dire situations and how you have to keep a positive attitude and not give in in spite of all the hardship that comes your way. Visually the movie is -as most Ridley Scott films are- pure eye-candy. The VFX looks hyperreal and are top of the line and the cinematography is superb. The music is mostly disco music but there is a reason for that in the story and it actually works well as a comedic effect. The film is actually similar to Apollo 13 which was better but was also based on true events. The Martian is a bit long at 141 mins and there is maybe a bit to much problem solving and sometimes not enough character background (e.g. what motivates Whatley to survive?).

3.0,"The Martian is the kind of film that cannot be done without a top leading man such as Matt Damon, who is very good as Mark Watney, an astronaut left stranded on Mars with the will and knowledge to survive before help arrives. Although slightly overlong, The Martian has mesmerizing production design with scenes of beautiful, burnt orange Mars surface, and surreal imagery of outer space that is similar to the film Gravity. However, the film does fall flat at times with the process of NASA discussing the best strategy to reach Watney. It's a solid watch, but it falls short of being a great film.

3.0,"One of the blockbusters of the year, a good adventure movie but an overrated one as well (8,2 in imdb). The Martian is Ridley Scott's return after his last good movie, Prometheus (2012).
Picture this one as a combination of the science of Apollo 13 (1995), combined with the survival element of Cast Away (2000) and the lost in space fun of Gravity (2013). After the recent success of Gravity (7 oscars for an all-right sci-fi adventure movie) it seems that space adventure movies can combine Academy Awards' appreciation with ticket selling.
The Martian is very well made, Ridley Scott's direction is impressive at some points and Matt Damon tries his best, but the movie is obviously not thought provocative. Still it's the perfect movie to have your pop corn with.

5.0,"Wow. This movie is incredible. It's directed beautifully. Ridley Scott has created a sci-fi masterpiece. The scenes on Mars are incredible! It doesn't feel like a set, it feels like you're actually looking at Mars, it feels like they are there. There's not one moment where it's not believable.
Matt Damon is SO very good in this movie. One of his best performances of his career. It's such an emotional and powerful performance, you're with him for the majority of the movie and you feel every triumph, every downfall, every emotion. It's such a good performance, a nomination worthy performance. He is so good. The other actors are all good too. Jeff Daniels is really good, Jessica Chastain is really good, and Michael Pena is great as well. All the supporting cast do a good job with what they have. But Matt Damon just powerhouses his performance and it's just so very good. It's his emotional and real performance that carries this movie.
The story is so well told and it's so very intriguing. The concept alone is brilliant. Hats off to the author of the book for coming up with the idea. The movie is such a good tale of human will, survival, ingenuity and overcoming the impossible. It's masterfully told and inspiring. It's one of the years best movies!

4.5,"Matt Damon (Cpt Watney) is stranded on Mars when his fellow astronauts think he is dead and leave the planet at the start of a devastating storm.

Initially the film seems to be a Robinson Crusoe-esque survival story in space and given Matt Damon's character is alone, we watch entertaining videos he makes for himself on his progress (quite unrealistic to expect he would do this or maintain his bonhomie for these - but I guess there's no other way to explain what he is doing to us - given that he is not even in contact with anyone else).

Thankfully, many of the facilities left behind are working and the first part of the film has science problems that Watney has to solve to stay alive. Quickly though the film starts to focus on Earth and his crewmates - and does very well at fleshing out their characters. I particularly liked the involvement of the director of media relations from the moment they know of Watney's survival - an amusing, realistic touch. From then on, NASA tried to solve its own problem of how to rescue Watney. This seems to have been done with a degree of realism unmatched in other portrayals of the organisation. Eventually with the help of the typical scruffy loner scientist and international collaboration (I was impressed that a Hollywood film has the Chinese space academy helping out the USA - was this to maturely reflect changing geopolitics or a marketing strategy?). Less impressive are typical tropes such as the scenes of everyone around the world watching for hours to see if Watney is rescued!

In the end, it is a very satisfying, very intelligent and action-packed film about space. It does not get dull as Interstellar frequently did, no artificially unexpected twists, and no ridiculous science. Even the credits sequence was excellent (the first time I've seen this) - with the film continuing on as the main cast are shown.",Krishna C,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 14, 2015",Krishna C,/user/id/972250987,RT,972250987,,The Martian

4.5,"The Martian is a 2015 science-fiction film that is directed by Ridley Scott,who finally decided to make good movies again,and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney in the leading role.Other stars are Jessica Chastain,Kristen Wiig,Jeff Daniels,Michael Peña, Kate Mara,Sean Bean,Sebastian Stan,Aksel Hennie,and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
The film is about some astronauts who after a storm blast off the planet Mars but they leave behind Mark Watney as he is presumed dead.He turns out to have survived the storm and with only a few supplies and food for counted days,he must use science and grow food in a place where nothing grows in order to survive until the next rescue mission comes for him.
I seriously loved this movie,the performances are all very great,especially Matt Damon who gives the performance of a lifetime.He seems very much committed to the role and he is full of emotion that equals to a great and Oscar-worthy performance.
Ridley Scott does an incredible job here with the way that he decides to take on the story and also the ending is just brilliant and very well directed.
The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also very haunting and memorable but what stands out the most here is the incredibly amazing cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.
The Mars scenes look great and they just feel real,them mixed with the very good visual effects just make for the perfect once in a lifetime experience.

4.0,"Ridley Scott occasionally strikes out from time to time but just like having a delicious bisque, future orders may not live up to your expectation but you keep ordering it because you know you might get something sublime.  Mr. Scott rewarded those who stuck with him by hitting a home run with his most recent film The Martian (2015). Ridley Scott has built his reputation on sci-fi world building and depicting the epic scope of a location/setting. The Martian (2015) has Mr. Scott certainly playing to his strong suits.
                In his latest outing Ridley Scott may not be a recreating the Roman Coliseum but he is still creating a vast epic world. The Setting/Landscape of Mars is imposing and its scale is very tangible to the audience. One couldn't help but think of the John Ford westerns that had Monument Valley as their backdrop. Man vs. Nature and the imposing desolate power of Mars is made clear early in this film. Mat Damon's Mark Watney sums up how he feels about the red giant when he says, ""fuck mars.""
                Ridley Scott is known for his world building. He earned that reputation directing films like Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), and Gladiator (2000). He reasserts his reputation as one of Hollywood's preeminent world builders in The Martian (2015). It's not just the breathtaking exteriors of Mars but his depiction of the space program of the near future and the familiar yet futuristic tech. of the space program.
                The Martian (2015) is an action movie whose hero Mark Watney played by Matt Damon never fires a gun. The inhospitable Martian environment is Mark Watney's enemy and science is his weapon. Math and other sciencey type montages are kept relatively cinematic and definitely exiting. The film's variety of quirky scientists and astronauts help add levity and help break up the relentless struggle that Mark Watney has to endure while marooned on Mars.
                Despite Mat Damon doing most of the heavy lifting after all he is playing the titular Martian the supporting cast is sizable in both talent and numbers. Jeff Daniels, Benedict Wong, Michael Pena, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover, Sebastian Stan, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all shine when they are on screen. Despite limited screen time the supporting cast is able to create distinct interesting characters.
                The Martian (2015) is a unique film. It's a science-fiction film that both genre fans and non genre fans can appreciate and enjoy. It's a thrilling action adventure romp yet there is no violence. Ridley Scott joins George Miller as a director who not only released one of the best films of his career in 2015 but he did so after 7 plus decades on planet Earth.Get stranded at your local cineplex for an hour or two and enjoy The Martian (2015).",Jake C,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 12, 2015",Jake C,/user/id/970997801,RT,970997801,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/644552905154/picture,The Martian

The film is also helped by easily finding Matt Damon's character to be likable and remain amazed at his ingenuity stranded on the red planet.

4.0,"Based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, the star-glossed latest blockbuster by Ridley Scott, titled simply The Martian has been making waves at the box office, and earning rave reviews by the critics. There's a lot of good stuff to talk about this ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" (as how director Scott intended to depict Matt Damon's character) flick, I'll still insist to do so without giving it away too much. So no spoilers, just like how I always prefer in my reviews.
The theme is rather straight forward. Damon's character Mark Watney, is a NASA astronaut who is incorrectly presumed dead by his crew members and left stranded alone on planet Mars. But what follows in this 141-minute adventure is an astounding and eye-opening journey by Watney which is nothing but simple; where the clever use of Science, Technology, Math and Engineering will be helping this man stay alive. First off, Scott's film has been praised for getting the crucial science right. The 77-year old director who has helmed numerous cinematic gems including Alien (1979), Thelma & Louise (1985) and Gladiator (2000), has taken serious measures to ensure he gets his science accurate, including getting Dr Jim Green, the director of NASA's Planetary Science Division to be one of his advisors on the film. Audience will revel in the series of ""MacGyver-moments"" pulled by Watney to survive on the Red Planet. Creating his own water. Building an entire garden to grow crops using Martian soil and his own feces as fertiliser. These are all inspiring yet appropriately accurate, scientifically. The Martian has even earned the approval from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who expressed appreciation on how much the film respects science. As far as comparisons with the novel, aside from Gone Girl (2014) Scott's film has been lauded as one of the most loyal book adaptation that Hollywood has produced to date. Even most of the dialogue used was lifted straight from Andy Weir's 2011 sci-fi novel.
With co-stars like Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier in Captain America) and Donald Glover (NBC sitcom Community), the film boasts a stellar cast; but Damon's performance single-handedly turns an epic tale of survival in space into something intimate and human. On his own he has to hold the screen for long stretches, talking to himself into the many cameras that serve as his daily log and in a way his refuge, and the Bourne-actor's performance is all convincing and engaging. He has managed to reap admiration for his eureka moments and yet becoming an empathetic everyman who audience will be rooting for.
The recent sci-fi blockbusters have all stretched themselves rather long, and my problem with the much raved-about Gravity (2013) was that it contained too much exasperation and literally hard-breathing and gasping moments and it somehow diluted a lot of other emotional angles of how the film should and could've been; hence making it felt rather long. I found myself thoroughly entertained throughout watching The Martian. There were comical moments as well, coupled with its feel-good 70s disco soundtrack, great performances by the cast collectively; and not to mention that Scott has not only captured the visually stunning landscapes of Mars, but cleverly filming the intimate landscapes of the main cast's faces, the film is profuse in both marvel and emotional achievements.",Jools A,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 11, 2015",Jools A,/user/id/972223247,RT,972223247,,The Martian

5.0,"Fantastic movie!  The best movie I've seen this fall!  Ridley Scott (Director) is back after a few less than stellar (recent) films.  Matt Damon is fantastic in the lead role as an astronaut who was presumed dead but fights to survive. The rest of the cast is stellar to include the dependable and highly underrated Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) and the phenomenal Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave).

5.0,"To accurately express how much I loved this movie, I must first post my effusive praise which I gave the book on Goodreads:

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:
I love thee for thy intelligence.
For thy sarcastic eloquence.
For thy manifestly scientific Grace.
For this lyrical ballet in deepest space.
For the tension and the humor at speed of light.
For tossing the fiction, and making the science right.
I love thy purely sense of adventure.
I love thee with the passion of a cosmos nerd.
I love the author's self-made venture.
And admire his moxie, for what it in me bestirs.
I love thee for my breathless tensure,
Smiles, tears, as not ever ere! Emotions ablurred.
I have enjoyed thee as I have never a book before.

The movie experience was pretty much the same: awesome on every level. Let me be clear at the outset, instead of neatly summarizing at the end: this may have been my most favorite book/movie experience ever.

Here's why I love most of the movies I love to death: everybody is smart. My favorites are littered with people who are thinking, thinking, thinking. This movie is rich and rife with smarts and intelligence pouring out of every pore.

It's basis begins with a smart writer, doing smart research, marketing his book smartly, selling the rights smartly to a smart movie production company who hired a smart director, a smart scriptwriter, and hired smart, perfectly cast actors.

The movie was not as detailed as the book, but it couldn't be, else it would have been 4 hours long - and even if it was, the entertainment value would not have been diminished a single iota. What they left out, and what they modified were smart decisions.

It is flawless, genius, mastercraft moviemaking, and Damon and his crew are aces in their performances. Those quibbling against Kristen Wiig's role know not what they speak of. She acted exactly as her character did in the book.

I am also emboldened by the apparent culture in NASA: people hold themselves accountable for their actions and decisions, and there is nobility throughout the film. There are no nefarious, bogus, bad guys. No, the bad guy is nature itself, who always acts rationally, and can be harnessed and countered.

Oh, the science! The science! The science is SO good! So good, it was delicious! I followed all of it and wasn't lost! I have to go see it again. Who's coming with?

4.5,"In The Martian, I love that the storyline doesn't completely abandon and give up on a single astronaut who gets mistakenly left behind on Mars. It was also heartening to see some international cooperation. This movie shows how space exploration is really a team effort in every way. It takes a lot of dedicated people working together to make it happen, most of them behind the scenes, and the work they do makes a difference as to whether the astronauts live or die.

Stranded astronaut Mark Watney survives on the red planet in spite of a lot of close calls, one day at a time, helping himself while a team back on Earth tries to figure out how to save him.  While waiting to be rescued, Watney uses both humor and ingenuity to survive. 

The habitats and equipment seemed realistic, although I was a bit skeptical about a single layer of plastic or canvas or duct tape being utilized in a few instances, but hey, it could work. Maybe...The beautiful rocky and sandy Martian landscape was reminiscent of images taken by real life Mars rovers that have been exploring the red planet for years. 

Ultimately, Captain Lewis and the crew have to make a decision whether or not to put their own lives on the line in order to try to save Watney's.

The pacing was my number one concern going in and I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually better at completely holding my attention than I expected. Matt Damon was excellent of course in the lead role and his goofy sense of humor made his character very likeable and also it had a different effect on me than I expected. I really wanted his character to be a real person as I'd love someone like him to be the first person on Mars. It's the pinnacle of human achievement so the first one there should be someone like Matt Damon. Actually, let's just send Matt Damon. I'd also be willing to go but I doubt that call will be coming any time soon.

4.5,"Wow! I did not expect this. Oh, I knew what was getting walking into ""The Martian"". I knew what the story was, I knew the visuals would likely be well done, and I knew it would be quite intense. I just didn't expect all those things to be so good and come together so well. I loved this movie! 

Just about everything in The Martian works. The story is emotionally riveting, the acting is great, the visuals are state of the art, the pace is mostly brisk, and this is the first time I've liked/rooted for Matt Damon in anything since ""The Departed"" in 2006. A bad main character can severely hurt a movie and here, unlike in ""Elysium"", Matt Damon oozes likability and charisma.

After getting separated and presumed dead by his crew during a severe sand storm, Damon is left behind and must figure out how to survive on the planet Mars until a rescue team can come for him, which could take years. This is where the movie truly shines. Most of the film focuses on Damon using his knowledge of science to survive; growing food, making water, contacting NASA, and maintaining mental stability. Watching him struggle while maintaining a hopeful and playful attitude all while video logging his daily activities is a lot of fun to watch.

The other side of the story is the NASA team trying to figure out how to bring Damon home. This is one thing I a really admired about the film. Just about every conflict and/or obstacle that happens feels natural and not contrived. I believed every source of drama would likely happen in real life. The pace of the NASA brainstorming scenes do drag a bit towards the end of the second act, but not for too long.

The scope of the movie is very interesting as well. It looks big and epic during the outer space sequences and Damon's exploration of Mars. At the same time, it also feels very claustrophobic, for Damon is all alone and can't step outside his lab without a spacesuit and that every breath he takes, every step could be his last. 

And last, but not least, director Ridley Scott. This is the first film of his that I've enjoyed since ""American Gangster"" in 2007 and his best work since ""Gladiator"" (2000) and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). I still may not be overly excited for his upcoming ""Prometheus"" sequel, but it's nice to see that he can still make great films. The Martian is the feel-good movie of the year, at least until ""Creed"" comes out.",Grant D,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 08, 2015",Grant D,/user/id/803452306,RT,803452306,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/555333093/picture,The Martian

1.5,"""The Martian"" and ""Red Planet""
I'm kind of surprised that no one has noticed the similarities ""The Martian"" has to ""Red Planet"" with Val Kilmer, released in 2000. Here's a few noteworthy plot devices that were first seen in ""Red Planet"" that seem to have coincidental reappearances in ""The Martian"".

1.
RP - Val Kilmer, by accident marooned on Mars (with other guys who get killed off, leaving him alone),and a female commander of the mission up in space (who eventually saves him).

TM - Matt Damon, by accident marooned on Mars, alone, and a female commander of the mission up in space (who eventually saves him).

2.
RP - Val finds the Sojourner rover (which luckily just happens to be nearby) and modifies it to call for help.

TM - Matt finds the Sojourner rover (which luckily just happens to be nearby) and modifies it to call for help.

3.
RP - The female mission commander makes the decision to stay in orbit and try to save Val.

TM - The female mission commander makes the decision to go back and try to save Matt. 

4.
RP - Val must make a long arduous journey to get to a Russian sample return launcher.

TM - Matt must make a long arduous journey to get to a NASA mission return launcher.

5.
RP - Val has to modify the sample return launcher to make it work, leaving him exposed to space when it launches.

TM - Matt has to modify the mission return launcher to make it work, he ends up being exposed to space when it launches.

6.
RP - The return launcher fouls up as it goes into space with Val aboard, requiring his mission commander to go out on a tether and retrieve him.

TM - The return launcher fouls up as it goes into space with Matt aboard, requiring one of the crew to go out on a tether and retrieve him.

** 

Of course Matt didn't have the inconvenience of the robot dog who was trying to kill him as Val had to contend with; but Val discovered he could breathe the Martian air that was generated by the seeded algae. So things even out pretty well.

4.0,"While it definitely isn't a comedy, The Martian was much more lighthearted and fun than I expected a movie about a stranded astronaut on Mars to be. Ridley Scott, who directed Sci-Fi masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner, finally has his best Sci-fi movie since.

The Martian just felt real, so much so that I caught my self getting lost in the story as if it actually happened. I cared for the characters and wanted to know more about their lives apart from the events depicted in the film. Also, it didn't follow the same formulas that other big budget space movies do. There was no ""villain"", yes there were obstacles but they all seemed organic. One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is when, like in Meet the Parents; every stupid little thing goes wrong. It pulls me out of the movie, and I roll my eyes as I look at my watch. The conflicts in the Martian, while steady, actually added to the tension. There certainly were plenty of challenges and set backs but they all served to progress the story, not just add another challenge or set back.

What could've been mundane was actually engaging and funny. Matt Damon deserves the accolades he is getting, but all of the performances were very good. Damon is a large part of the film, but none of the other actor's talents were wasted. Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels Chewitel Ejiofor were all very compelling, and felt genuine.  It isn't often that you get a Science Fiction movie that feels grounded and plausible.

5.0,"A wonderful adaption and an important movie, in the landscape of today's exceedingly pessimistic science fiction. There is a real trend of fear of science, in today's science fiction -- something that stems from the coldness of the subject. There is a trend of fear of scientists and intellect. In this movie, science is shown to be what it is: not a weapon or whatever the public fears it to be, but a tool. A scientist is shown to be no more than he or she is: not an evil genius, but a person, who happens to be a cool scientist. A woman is a captain of a space voyage. A black man is a leading director of some big department within NASA (the name of the department escapes me). There is no ""token"" role for any race of gender. The roles in the movie are split evenly between race and gender. Countries work together... enormous sacrifices are made by both sides to save one man. The movie is about coming together to use science and engineering to save one man, as a metaphor for using science to save all of man. There is some expository dialogue that wouldn't make sense as a conversation between scientists, but they're not populous. Danny Glover's acting is strange and does not fit the tone of the rest of the movie. I feel like the director should have told him something. I read the book before watching the movie and noticed a few things right away. Half of the book seemed to be missing, but that shouldn't take away from the movie. This should only be incentive to read the book or listen to the audiobook (the audio book is my preference) after watching the movie. The tone of the book is quite different.

That there is musical score in just about every god damned scene, the camera is always zooming and dollying, and that there is nary a static shot is par for the course for most big budget films made these days, but for Ridley Scott to be making films in this manner demonstrates that he's lost his ability to tell a story without smoke and mirrors.

4.5,"While it is not among the best science fiction movies, The Martian is surprisingly witty and funny for a space misadventure revolving around a single character. Matt Damon's lone some adventure is a thrill thanks to his optimistic characterization, while keeping in mind the reality of things, the visual and sound effects, and the editing and flow of scenes.

On a mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and his crew are caught in a sand storm. His crew manages to escape and leaves him behind, believing him dead. Instead of going through the usual depressing phase, he does just the opposite; he analyzes his situation and starts thinking how he can use what he has to survive.

Directed by Ridley Scott, The Martian brings out the strange optimism one rarely finds in a space misadventure. Matt Damon challenges his situation from the very beginning by saying ""I am not going to die here"", and keeps a light tone throughout the rest of the movie. However, while Matt Damon does a great job in portraying his emotions, the viewer is never able to forget the situation thanks to the amazing visuals and set design.

Even though the movie moves a little too fast, it is understandable since it develops in a long period of time. It would be impossible to portray this day by day without ending with a boring plot. More importantly, the problems are explained emotionless intriguing the viewer in the science involved and letting us know what is going on at all times (with a bit of suspense, of course), which is always a challenge when a movie is based on a book written in first person.

While the basic plot is not anything out of the ordinary, the personality of the protagonist is something rare in a space thrill. This along with beautiful visuals, awkward but funny jokes, and an amazing way of explaining each and every scene, The Martian will have you rooted to your seat, not waiting for the moment on when Mark will survive, but on how he will do it.",Alex G,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 06, 2015",Alex G,/user/id/906804705,RT,906804705,,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is the glorious return to form for Ridley Scott after a string of questionable projects and this movie blew me away on every level, largely due to the realistic science the film portrays and the captivating, nearly one-man-show performance from Matt Damon. Based on the book by Andy Weir, and adapted by the rising star, Drew Goddard, the story follows a botanist who is assumed dead during a catastrophic solar storm and left to fend for himself on Mars using his brain and ingenuity to keep himself alive until he can be rescued. First off, the film is absolutely stunning with gorgeous cinematography and extremely impressive visual effects, not to mention the fact that I completely bought the fact that he was stranded on mars; that's how real the sets looked. Second, the acting is off-the-charts impressive with one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen with the likes of: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Michael Peña, and of course, Matt Damon who owns this movie from the get-go. And lastly, this film's biggest secret: it is HILARIOUS! I have never been more pleasantly surprised that a film could be so clever, witty, intelligent, and exciting all at the same time and there are NUMEROUS laugh-out-loud moments. That's not to say there aren't harrowing moments as well; I found myself on edge throughout hoping the character would make it through his ordeal and it's quite suspenseful at times.

There's something about the vast desert landscape of Mars that lends itself well to cinematography, and the CGI is very convincing.

4.0,"A super fun and hearty film that showcases a return to form for Ridley Scott. The Martian's strongest point is it's protagonist Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon. In a time where most all films with this type of subject material would be dark and gloomy, Damon's character brings a humorous and light hearted feel to this movie, despite it's seemingly bleak scenario. This movies primary driving force is problem solving. This is essentially a movie about a man using science and critical thinking to solve a string of problems in an attempt to get him back home to earth. Watching the interesting turns of events unfold is quite entertaining, though it does feel as if the ""Solve the problem with science"" is being overused by the end of the films runtime. This whole problem solving mantra is what presents the main conflict within this film: scientific accuracy. Now, this is NOT the film to watch if you want an accurate space movie, I knew that going in to this, but this film presents itself in a way that takes it's science-filled problem solutions too seriously to then turn around and pull the (Small spoiler) Glove-Propulsion trick.

5.0,"A wonderful adaption and an important movie, in the landscape of today's exceedingly pessimistic science fiction. There is a real trend of fear of science, in today's science fiction -- something that stems from the coldness of the subject. There is a trend of fear of scientists and intellect. In this movie, science is shown to be what it is: not a weapon or whatever the public fears it to be, but a tool. A scientist is shown to be no more than he or she is: not an evil genius, but a person, who happens to be a cool scientist. A woman is a captain of a space voyage. A black man is a leading director of some big department within NASA (the name of the department escapes me). There is no ""token"" role for any race of gender. The roles in the movie are split evenly between race and gender. Countries work together... enormous sacrifices are made by both sides to save one man. The movie is about coming together to use science and engineering to save one man, as a metaphor for using science to save all of man.

There is some expository dialogue that wouldn't make sense as a conversation between scientists, but they're not populous.

Danny Glover's acting is strange and does not fit the tone of the rest of the movie. I feel like the director should have told him something.

I read the book before watching the movie and noticed a few things right away. Half of the book seemed to be missing, but that shouldn't take away from the movie. This should only be incentive to read the book or listen to the audobook (the audio book is my preference) after watching the movie. The tone of the book is quite different.

5.0,"            ""The Martian"" 
            Director: Ridley Scott
            Cast: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Micheal Peña, and Chiwetel Ejifor
            Producer: 20th Century Fox
            Rated: PG-13

  ""The Martian"", is directed by ""Ridley Scott, the director of many marvelous movies such as the recent ""Prometheus"". Mr.Scott, has done it yet again with ""Martian"", a really fun and enjoyable Sci-Fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon as the man stuck on Mars after a terrible Ares mission. This movie is definite must see and you would probably never want it to end. 

 Mark Whatney (Damon), is left on Mars after a bad storm and a awful mission named Ares 3. His crew is certain of his death and reports it to NASA, the lead of the mission. It turns out that he really is alive, and he is making a living. The rest of the movie is about how he gets back home.

Now, let me say that this movie is around two and half hours. It's usually really hard to keep people engaged the whole time, but this movie does it perfectly. It has its own blend of science, comedy, and action, at the same time developing the plot. The screenplay and performances are amazing, and You can definetly say that Chiwetel is one of the best actors of our time. Not saying the pat Matt Damon isn't good, but his character is very plain and ordinary, even though he pulls of the smart-look very well and is mostly taken care of with CGI. The way that this movie is put together, edited, and executed is just fantastic, and it's really really engaging. The soundtrack in this movie is just amazing and keeps you very satisfied throughout the whole movie. 

  This movie albeit is very predictable and boring at some times, which is ok, considering that it is really long. Matt's humor really works well, and is absolutely spectacular when you need to relieve tension. This movie has a strong message that is given in a different and very amazing way. They show you survival, tension, and love. It is hard to understand at times, but you have to understand that Hollywood tried its best to make it super simple and understandable. Al of the science references were neat, and all the characters looked and behaved very sharp, except for Kate Mara who just struggled. Jeff Daniels in this movie doesn't really fit as the director of NASA and always reminds me of ""Dumb and Dumber"". Seeing him looks like a joke, and doesn't really fit the serious role at times. 

  The characterization and description for each character is very well done. You would really really care about the characters and worry about them, as if you were really dragged in to the movie. The CG is mindblowing, even if there is a short resemblance to the Grand Canyon at many places. The shooting, setting, and character time placement is very well done and is surely not a miss.

 After going through two-years of development hell, this movie definetly lives up to the hype and does justice. Ridley Scott, is the man for this movie even though he isn't as consistent. When seeing movies like ""Exodus"", you'll probably lose touch for him. But this movie is smart, executed well, sharp, and has some really really good performances. Like I said, it's really really hard to engage people in a movie for two and half hours, but this movie does that perfectly. ""The Martian"" should not be a miss, and is a visual-popcorn thriller treat for the audiences.

4.5,"A stunning triumph that takes the art of 3D to a new level.  The Martian is visually stimulating, from beginning to end.  And even though it arrives shortly after other outer-space blockbusters (Gravity and Interstellar) The Martian is fully capable of standing on it's own.  It successfully carves out it's own niche within the genre. The captivating plot has a beautiful mixture of humour, suspense, and problem solving.  It contains a heavy dose of science, for sure, but because it's so brilliantly presented and articulated, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer (or even the plot for that matter).  From botany to particle physics to the environment on Mars, the science all checks out because author Andy Weir allowed the relevant experts within each field to verify the scientific validity of the plot.

The star of the show, Matt Damon, is able to evoke a sense of empathy from the viewer like few others in Hollywood are capable of.  From Rounders to Good Will Hunting, and from Green Zone to the Bourne trilogy, he is able to get the viewer to root for him and believe in his cause.  The entire cast is able to portray their characters in a manner that feels genuine and real.  Jeff Daniels as NASA Head Honcho Teddy Sanders is able to successfully channel all that we love (and hate) about Will McAvoy.  Donald Glover makes a name for himself now as an actor in addition to being a Grammy nominated artist.  And a particular treat was watching Michael Pena absolutely nail one of the most heart-warming scenes I've had the pleasure of viewing this year, in a subdued yet obviously emotional exchange with Matt Damon.
As movie fans we've unfortunately had the displeasure of watching Hollywood fall flat on it's face time and time again in it's attempts at turning a best selling novel into a worthy big screen adaptation.  Hence Ridley Scott and Drew Goddard deserve to be singled out and praised for successfully transforming Andy Weir's page turning book into a blockbuster movie.

4.5,"""The Martian"" is an epic fantasy film that transports us to a planet that has always been enshrouded in mystery.  In most situations, I would automatically rank this film at a 10 for its impeccable acting, well-written script, and awesome special effects.  Unfortunately, 2013's ""Gravity"" and 2014's ""Interstellar"" set an unfair expectation, unintentionally branding this as ""2015's Token Space Movie.""  With the inevitable comparisons, this film seems weak; still, it deserves a high rating for the aforementioned reasons.  ""The Martian"" is worth seeing solely for Matt Damon.  The story ranges from comedy to drama and from action to mindbender, all within Damon's one-man-show.  Everything from Damon claim of being the best horticulturalist on Mars to his communication using the hexadecimal alphabet makes his character likable and enhances our desire to see him return home.  A second story counters Damon's experiences on Mars.  This story brings in A-list actors Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara, all of whom support the strong emotional content of the story.  One of the strengths of this screenplay is that it remains believable.  I have been told that the Damon faces many more issues in the book, but any more than what is contained in this film would make his survival seem farfetched.  While fans of the book may view this as an injustice to the source material, I believe it to be a victory.

It's all very intense and unnerving to watch the problem-solving unfold, but the tension is alleviated by the film's well-paced use of humor - a disco-heavy soundtrack is just one way the mood is lightened and Watney learns to grow his own food... using human waste! The skillful combination of a well-written script, talented cast, out-of-this-world special effects and lighter moments make ""The Martian"" the kind of movie that will stick with you long after you've watched it.

3.5,"(68%)
A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likeable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others.

3.0,"The Martian is a fun spectacle of a film.  The 3D is decent enough to actually add something to the film without ever coming across as a gimmick.  The performances, cinematography and direction are all top notch and can't be faulted.  Where the film doesn't work for me is that I never ever get a sense that astronaut Mark Watney is truly stranded or helpless.  Throughout the film, whenever a problem arises or is fortold, the solution comes about either withing the same dialogue, the next piece of dialogue, or the next scene (or two).  There is no sense of dread or despair really present in this film.  Considering this astronaut is stranded on Mars, one would think that him never getting home would be a primary theme in this film but a film about a dude on an island with a volleyball for a friend managed to do a much better job of that somehow.  The Martian is but a small step above a popcorn flick but thanks for some stunning visuals, that step can feel like a giant leap.

3.0,"Impeccably made and with a great, charming performance from Mad Damon, The Martian suffers from a similar problem as other ""stranded disaster movies."" The biggest issue here is that any time the film returns to earth, it loses any and all momentum is had built up. The mars scenes are gorgeous, effecting, and surprisingly entertaining and when the film returns to Earth countless times, everything comes to a screeching halt. Even the scenes on the space station Hermes, who are in a unique position to possibly rescue Damon's stranded Mark Watney, are formulaic. Scott's visuals, though, remain as potent as ever and I can't stress enough how gorgeous and well put together the Mars scenes are. Another problem I had was the completely predictable plot. At one point, Jeff Daniels' NASA chief says something to the effect of ""I hope nothing else goes wrong!"" and, what do you know, the next scene shows a supply ship headed for Watney explode. WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING?!?! I also never thought for a second that he wouldn't be rescued, training much of the tension of the movie.

4.0,"American cinema's favourite damsel in distress, Matt Damon, once again acts as the catalyst for a troupe of better men (and women) to come to his aid, albeit with the new twist that this one concentrates on his efforts to last until rescue rather than the valiant efforts of his saviours, as did Saving Private Ryan and Interstellar.  This is sci-fi with an emphasis on science, and the layperson does have to take a fair bit on faith.

4.5,"The Martian is everything I hoped it would be and more.  It is science fiction that falls heavily on the science side of that term, which means the movie is intelligent and doesn't condescend to the audience.  Yet they also took time to have fun with the story, and perhaps stretched logic a little at times.  There is a fair amount of comedy in the movie so, despite the extremely tense story, there were a number of moments when the entire theater erupted with laughter.  I think this is my favorite Matt Damon performance ever.  Usually I find him flat and uninteresting, or over-dramatized.  Yet he embraced the wise-cracking nature of Mark Watney, and actually sold me on the more emotional moments as well.  I was on his side from the beginning which I never expected with Matt Damon in the lead role.

The whole film felt like it was based on true events.  It was very reminiscent of Apollo 13, which made the tension even more palpable.  You felt like this was something that happened to a real person, and wondered if he could survive.  I loved how there wasn't a villain in the story, too.  There's nothing more inspiring to me than movies where everyone pulls together in order to solve a problem and that's what The Martian is all about.  The collaboration between so many different people was superb.  Everyone including mission control, the crew on the Watney's ship, and even the bureaucrats running NASA were willing to risk everything to do the right thing.  Of course that's not even mentioning all the amazing problem-solving that Watney has to do on his own.  I was touched by his struggles to survive, and felt so much sympathy whenever he hit a roadblock.  If I were to make any complaint at all it would be that we didn't get enough time with the crew of the Hermes.  I think it might have added a little more emotional impact to certain scenes if they were put center stage during more of the film.  However, it's a minor flaw in what I found to be an extremely entertaining film.  The Martian is one of those rare movies that I have recommended to everyone, so don't miss it.",Ben L,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 27, 2015",Ben L,/user/id/855043855,RT,855043855,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1077523731/picture,The Martian
4.5,"The Martian is a Ridley Scott film and don't worry..... its a good one. Yes, the Alien director has been fairly inconsistent of late but put together a great film in the Martian. Obviously we can't give Scott all the credit because the performances were top notch. Matt Damon was both hilarious and electric in his role as Mark Watney. Also Chiwetel Ejiofor was so good in this movie, and i can definitely see him getting a supporting actor nod for his role. Now lets attend back to my hard on for Mr.Scott. One thing you can always expect when walking into a Ridley Scott film is that it will be visually stunning, and this film is GORGOUS. Mars is a character of its own in this film like Mount Everest is to ""Everest"". The planet looks like the coolest sandbox you'll ever visit and probably had people checking Expedia for one way trips. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that i they try and tie in his parents at one point late in the film and i just wish there was more to that. His parents seem to be the only family he has on earth and i believe that if they were able to just touch on their relationship just a bit more then that would add a scoop of give a **** for the viewers.

5.0,"Acting was great. This was a feel good space movie. It looks like the film was heavily heavily co-opted by NASA and JPL though.  Due to the amount of science and tech artifacts they had, and also the amount of logos used, and seemingly accurate space talk. I have to say this is a 180? flip from how films have been portraying near term space travel. Usually, space is depicted as cold, confusing, hopeless, spinning, pressure losing, void. 

Pros: What this film did was actually make space travel look fun and appealing. Which brings me to this: is the industry gong to stop making ""space"" looking like an ice cold spinning void, and start making it look like a long trip on southwest airlines? 

Cons: I would have liked to see outside of Matt Damon's botany lab and car VLOGs, and to see more adventurous stunts like him climbing, finding caves, and showing some of the actual life that is on Mars now. Instead I felt like we were a little cooped up in his small labs, and we didn't get a feel for home much adventure is actually awaiting us on Mars.

4.0,"Lately critically acclaimed movies about space have lacked something for me. The visuals were gorgeous but their stories were lacking and I wasn't emotionally attached to their characters to buy into the visual experience. But Ridley Scott manages to fuse both the spectacle of space with characters that are humanly fleshed out, and adds another jewel to his filmography after half a decade of frustrating work. The film rest on 2 key features, Drew Godard's Script and Matt Damon's character. Drew Godard makes a great script, full of fun quotes and one-liner's which helps sell the appeal to Damon's acting. Damon also does a great job as the character, fighting for his life on Mars. The science of the film seems to check out overall well and i love how the problems they have affect everything. The cast is an all star crew, from Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor, to Jessica Chastain &Kristen Wiig, everyone in the cast does a great job. The cinematography especially some of the shots on Mars look gorgeous as well , and the old boy Ridley Scott with great material and talent, comes away with another gem in his filmography. The Martian works because i can buy into the characters, buy into the science, and buy into the fun of it all. The Martian has the perfect mix of everything.

3.5,"Held up by the performances, which are great across the board. Lotta life and humor in incidental moments. The effects are great (apart from a few Mars-scape flyovers that look like Google Earth footage), the sound design is fantastic, the sets are fantastic, the music is cool, etc, super cool production all around. The only thing holding it back imo is the super controlled plotting. It becomes apparent very quickly that this isn't a space thriller a la Apollo 13, or even really a survival movie a la Castaway, but a space procedural. It becomes apparent very quickly, from the bright tone and broad perspective, that there's no real question whether or not Matt Damon will survive his ordeal. Which would be fine, but the plot keeps throwing survival thriller-esque challenges at the characters as soon as the previous one gets resolved, forcing itself to deal with the technical hurdles to survival instead of the much more interesting social and political challenges it brings up. I liked the bureaucratic drama, the web of technical and political jugglings faced by the teams on Earth and in space, but it didn't go far enough with them, never producing any lasting drama out of tough decisions. Every problem, large and small, gets resolved very quickly and competently, usually by a deus ex machina'd brand new genius character (Donald Glover) or organization (China's space program) or conveniently remembered piece of equipment (Pathfinder) that shows up halfway or more through the movie. There ends up being no real sticking drama at all, whether from the survival side of the story or the political one.

3.5,"The cultivation of potatoes in Mars
The Marshall comedy film starring Matt Damon and directed by Scott Radley
No one expected the film's director, Ridley Scott and watched what to expect, especially after the failed last film which tells the story of Moses with Pharaoh of Egypt
Also mistaken to compare the film with Inter Astler or Bjraveta film comes much less mattresses and not worth aura contoured before introducing the film is not a semi-previous films does not compare them never entered .. If the movie and watch what you expected Anavvs would hand these films inevitably frustrating ..
The film is not of the movies that agree Rated easily, the main problem I figured out that he was expected. We have not seen a review of the person isolated on Mars, but not inspiring story of hope and stuck to life, but not important heroic rescue, but how sweet potato cultivation, yes The film seemed to comedy and ended up comedy.
The film was a skit .. very funny I was not in the right place .. In my opinion space Hollywood is not a place for comedy funny that pay millions for the production of film space to turn in the end the film is a comedy ... freinds TV version ...
Unfortunately, the film was without the roles of women did not find any remarkable role of a woman is of importance and impact of a prominent film
NASA sessions was boring, especially in decision-making and review of the options available and feel that the film was exaggerated and took more time than necessary.

It had all the hallmarks of a Ridley Scott ripping yarn. It was fun, slick, spectacular and gripping.
But, and I say this with great regret, it failed to deliver on any level other than a shallow ride. 
And yet there were so many opportunities to explore so many human frailties, strengths and emotions. but Scott seems to have bowed to Hollywood pressure to spin a shallow yarn.
Others have commented on it but the deep questions this raises about purpose, about loneliness, about luck, about comradeship, about failure, about bravery, about courage, about the very purpose of space exploration. All came begging with great actors and sets and a story line that would have easily carried them, all went begging.

5.0,"Films made from novels are usually great in my opinion. I think screenwriting a story without a famous novel behind it may be fading by convention. ""The Martian"" is one of those hip cool novel-to-movie examples. I read the first few chapters before seeing the movie. The understated humor and NASA space themes drew me in right away. That and the universal praise of the critics put seeing this one at a high priority.

""Star Wars"" proved a global love for space movies. ""Castaway"" did the same for survival films. It's likely ""The Martian"" draws from both audiences along with readers of the novel. It's already being given ""Blockbuster"" status in the press. In the story, a manned mission to Mars goes wrong and an astronaut, thought to be dead, is left behind.

Director Ridley Scott takes on a book adaptation about an astronaut left stranded on the desolate and unforgiving red planet, Mars.

5.0,"Astronaut botanist Mark Watney is accidentally left behind by his team mates on Mars when a storm hits the planet.  Alone and with barely enough supplies to last, Watney struggles to survive while everyone else on Earth aspires to bring him home (after a ""cover-up"" of his presumed death).  You know you're watching a great movie when every second nails you to your seat with riveting rawness.  Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is one of those movies.  Magnetic from the start and highlighted by a tour-de-force performance by Matt Damon as the title character, THE MARTIAN could in some ways be considered like CAST AWAY in outer space.  This is arguably Scott's most intense movie ever; frightening as his previous ALIEN was, it was above all a science-fiction fantasy with its scares marked toward the visceral.  Here the subject focuses on a man whose only major opponent on Mars are intense weather storms that at times tear apart his only survival makeshift camp.  This lends of feeling of chilling realism, and, at least one point, grisliness (one early scene in the picture involves Damon performing surgery on a wound he receives from a broken antenna).  THE MARTIAN is all the more convincing for it.  The supporting cast is terrific, but as mentioned, it's because of Damon's compelling turn that the audience roots for his survival.  While Ridley Scott's track record can be uneven, he has on occasion delivered great results.

4.0,"The Martian is Ridley Scott's return to form. After a slew of forgettable films he brings us a believable space movie with a good heart at the core of it. The Martian is not as ambitious as Interstellar but it is definitely better than the overrated Gravity. The science is much more understandable. In the grim backdrop of a lone astronaut trapped on the red planet, Scott infuses surprising wit and humor thanks to Matt Damon's prowess as an actor. Strangely though not surprisingly it is a fact that many of the actors didn't even cross paths during shooting yet the film looks so coherent. The film benefits from the fact that it doesn't muddle up the story in want of gorgeous 3D or special effects though there is plenty of it to keep it balanced. The climax would have you clutching your seat as the scene unfolds in some really well shot action. There is probably just one hitch.

4.5,"When I first saw trailers for ""The Martian"" I was instantly hooked. The story of a castaway... on another planet? Sign me up! Then I heard reactions from the trailer, how the plot is ludicrous, that there's no way NASA would attempt a rescue mission because those astronauts know what they're getting into and such an endeavor would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Rest assured, there's nothing about this movie that's ludicrous. It all makes sense and as an extra kicker, it's one heck of a ride. This is the kind of movie where you better make sure to apply some deodorant beforehand, otherwise your neighbors' attention will be diverted by your perspiration.

Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, an astronaut who finds himself stranded on Mars when a sudden storm forces the crewmembers of the Ares III to abort their mission. While the world watches, he must find ways to survive using every bit of ingenuity at his disposal.

While the main character is undoubtedly Mark, there's a lot more going on here than you expect. This film is like your average ""Cast Away"" story, with the amount of danger cranked up to a nearly unfathomable level. It's one thing being stuck alone on a rock you can't escape, but our hero isn't even on a planet that can sustain life, the average temperature on the surface is a cool -55°C, there's no water, no air, limited supplies and only because they were left behind when everyone else left in a hurry and on top of all that, he has to figure out a way to contact NASA, who assumes he died. This is a story that doesn't need a villain because the odds are stacked so high that you have no idea how he's going to make it past the 30 day mark, never mind find a way home. 

The titular Martian is just a fraction of what you have to look forward to. What the previews don't show you is the other side of the story, the part where everyone on Earth is scrambling to figure out what to do. When is it the right time to release images that prove that Mark Watney survived? Oh wait, there's no choice because NASA is a government organization and they only have a 24-hour window before they're compelled to divulge the information. How do we figure out how to break it to the world that X is going on, that our plan is Y or that our solution to that thing that went wrong is Z? It's a maze of bureaucratic decisions, PR nightmares, stressed-out departments attempting to work in unison with punishingly tight deadlines... and all that while trying to coordinate actions with someone whose answers take 24 minutes to reach Earth.

What had me gripped about ""The Martian"" is that this is a story that's filled to the brim with intelligence. Everyone has to think on his or her feet at all times. It's about making calculations to ensure that the trajectory of this shuttle will be just right so they don't have to expend too much fuel, or about doing the math to figure out exactly how long supplies can last. Our protagonist becomes a real Robinson Crusoe, using every little stray bit of plastic wrap or discarded piece of Earth technology to last that extra day. You're always sitting there wondering ""what are they going to come up with next?"" in the most excited way possible.


This movie celebrates intelligence; it shows you the dangers of space travel and makes you feel unbridled terror as you realize the loathsome void that is the universe outside of Earth's atmosphere. It's a story where a piece of duct tape folding onto itself can mean death by suffocation. And it's also quite often very funny. The last thing I expected was to laugh out loud, but I did, and frequently too. You know how even in the worst situations you can find humor in things? Well that happens a lot here. It's because this film by Ridley Scott is a masterwork of character development and relationships. We have 14, yes that's right 14 characters prominently featured at one point or another, all of which have real life to them, personalities and real interacts between the other people their interact with. I was also impressed with the fact that we have major characters of different ethnicities present... and the fact that they are Chinese, Black or Latino in no way shape their characters. It's really is a world in itself because there's so much going on here, even when it's just two people talking via email or making a decision about something that's going to happen millions of kilometers away.

""The Martian"" is above all else, fun. It's thrilling, it's funny, it makes you think and it's all based on real science! I can't explain why or how, but I almost felt as if I wanted to be in Mark Watney's shoes, showing to the entire world how ingenious I could be by pooling together every last bit of relevant information and surviving on a distant world. I'd be dead in a few hours but that's the great thing about movies, they allow you to live vicariously through these fantasies brought to life. I almost forgot to mention that this is a great looking movie, one that shows off the beauty of a desolate world ruled by the solar system's largest volcano and populated by endless craters and canyons. Even if you're not a space travel enthusiast like myself, it's well worth your time.

4.5,"Listening to ""I Will Survive"" during the end credits, I almost gave this film a full five-star, almost. This film is almost perfect in every sense - a well-balanced script, tight directing and editing with excellent tempo, a superb cast of which every single actor/actress has his/her own chance to shine, and shone brightly they did indeed. This is maybe Ridley Scott's best action film that I have watched since ""Gladiator"" (the director-cut version of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is rather a historical drama/epic) - extremely entertaining, surprisingly funny (and witty), and profoundly emotional. It is very very difficult to reach a balance between such different aspects of human feelings within one single film, even more difficult for a sci-fi action film, but Ridley Scott, finally, after numerous failures recently, was able to marvel such feat, the film feels so humanistic despite its futuristic setting and fast tempo (and definitely the best Chinese propaganda piece since it became to reach out to Hollywood with its limitless pocket). It is really unfair for this film not receiving five-star from me, given the fact that I did give ""Gravity"" five stars, and ""The Martian"" seems to be superior in most aspects. Except one, the depth of the story and character development. The film was so well done that most of the audience, in my opinion, will forget that there is almost no character development in the film, its characters stay mostly the same during the course of the film, despite the fact that this type of near-death experience will definitely have transformation impact on human's characteristics. Having an all-nice cast is not a bad idea (I have longed for films with all-nice cast, so that I can have some time to relax with films, rather than scratching my head not knowing what I am watching). But giving their ""niceness"" only one dimension without further difference is a little bit disappointing, such potential characters totally deserve a bigger playground. Of course an action film can also excel by being ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", but the emptiness of the universe really need some colours for the characters other than the colour of nicety. Still, this film deserves all the praises it has got so far, and watching this film in IMAX 3D will be another unforgettable experience for me (after ""Gravity"", which has simpler plot but better cinematography).",Viet Phuong N,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 23, 2015",Viet Phuong N,/user/id/846471446,RT,846471446,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1624370347/picture,The Martian

5.0,"Don't make the mistake of skipping a trip to your local theater to  ""The Martian.""

There's too many reasons not to miss out on what likely will go down as one of the premier science fiction films of the decade - thought everything right about the movie starts and ends with Matt Damon.

As with all films about the stranded or marooned, a film requiring one man all alone to spend several cinematic years on another planet requires a phenomenal performance from Hollywood's elite class of actors - and ""The Martian"" has that in spades with a tour de force effort by Damon.

In Mark Watney, Damon exudes the everyman qualities of an actor like Tom Hanks, melding it with the wry humor of George Clooney and the lovable charm of Leonardo DiCaprio to create a dynamic, layered character that audiences actually enjoy watching all by his lonesome for over an hour. 

Damon's engaging portrayal of Watney, along with some creative editing from director Ridley Scott and his team, keep ""The Martian"" interesting for much longer than the film's premise might suggest.

Audiences have seen a lot of variety in Damon's work over the past two decades. While his work in the Jason Bourne franchise and as the lead in ""Good Will Hunting"" - which he co-wrote with Ben Affleck - are probably the most iconic Damon performances in the minds of casual moviegoers, his turn as Watney has to vault into the same stratosphere.

Viewers can't help but root for Watney in a way that hasn't been seen since Hanks covered a volleyball with blood to help stay sane in ""Castaway,"" which arrived in theaters more than 15 years ago. 

""The Martian"" is Matt Damon's movie through and through and is quite possibly the best work he's ever done, no small feat in an illustrious career.

It would have been easy for Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard  to just let a top-notch performance stand on its own two feet, giving Damon ample room and the full 142 minutes of running time for a one-man show. 

However, they rightfully opted to stay true to the source material - Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name - and included both Watney's fellow astronauts and NASA flight crew as pivotal members of a strong, talented ensemble cast led by Academy Award nominees Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

More than half of the supporting actors - Chastain, Ejiofor, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig - have the talent to carry their own films, but willingly sacrifice their own screen time in deference to the movie's needs, which benefits the audience more than Damon or Scott. With Chastain leading the way in space and Ejiofor on Earth, every single scene has the same impact even if Damon's not involved at all.

As much as viewers want to see what's going on with Watney on Mars, there's no drop off in scenes without Damon - something that couldn't be said for a classic film like ""Apollo 13,"" where you just wanted to get back to Hanks floating around the moon as soon as possible after the scene cuts away to Earth.

""The Martian"" also proves to be a big comeback for Scott after missing big with ""The Counselor,"" ""Prometheus"" and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings."" Everything seems to click all the way through for Scott, who's able to blend numerous top-notch acting performances with beautifully shot cinematography from Dariusz Wolski and the most visually dynamic computer graphic imagery this side of ""Gravity.""

""The Martian"" represents Scott's best work in more than a decade, harkening back to 2001's ""Black Hawk Down"" and 2000's ""Gladiator.""

Though the film is based on a science-heavy fiction novel, it's not necessary for moviegoers to have read the book previously or earned a degree in astrodynamics to enjoy ""The Martian"" as the cinematic masterpiece that it is. It's also unnecessary to go out of your way to catch the film's 3D version as the 2D experience is just as compelling - a recommendation that cannot be made about either ""Everest"" or ""The Walk,"" films that are must-sees in the in-your-face 3D format they were intended to be viewed in.

For science-fiction drama, ""The Martian"" is exceedingly funny, with a number of pop culture references and a ""Lord of the Rings"" Easter egg joke to boot. The film does include more heavy language than your average PG-13 film and brief male rear nudity, though younger moviegoers allowed to watch films with cursing are likely capable of handling the science-heavy material, thanks to Goddard's viewer-friendly script.

Though an upcoming sequel in the ""Star Wars"" franchise still has yet to way in, ""The Martian"" is by far the best science-fiction film since Oscar-winner ""Gravity"" and a definite must-see in theaters.

4.5,"""In your face, Neil Armstrong!""
Only in a Matt Damon movie can one pull off such witticism. I bet you, if Neil is alive, he'll be like ""F*ck you, Matt Damon!"" But, to be fair, those smart witticism, jokes and the awesome script was written for him by the Screenwriters.. So, hats off to them. Personally, I did not understand the Iron Man reference until of course Mark Watney 'flew' resembling our lovable super hero Iron Man himself.
For a movie showcasing a Man's survival on an uninhabited planet waiting to be saved, this movie offers all the suspense, humor, action, drama, practically everything you can hope for from a movie. Matt Damon played a major role in making us cry for him, root for him.. all the while make us think of what would happen if we were stranded on a deserted planet like that. And thanks to Captain Lewis, the scores for this movie is also great. Having to pick from her disco records, The Martian entertained its audience by playing musics from the 70s disco era. Much like ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"", this move keeps its audience alert and brings their focuses back to the movie, if ever one was got drifted away. Director, Ridley Scott really created magic, pulling us all in with fantastic graphics and sets that, to the eyes of a common person such as myself, really seemed real and authentic. The red sands, the vast desert.. He brought Mars to Earth!

5.0,"Good quote from Mark Watney - The Martain.

At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.

5 things I learn from The Martian.
1. Don't give up. You can be discouraged, but don't give up.
2. Think positive. Try to have good sense of humor.
3. Life is problem solving. Don't avoid it.
4. Keep calm and make a plan.

4.5,"""Cast Away in Mars""
The Great Director Ridley Scott is Back, The Man who brought Gladiator, Alien and Kingdom of Heaven is back with a New Masterpiece.
This Movie is Incredible, it's a very uplifting story about survival 
The Performances Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and every single person in this cast is excellent.
The Music by ""Harry Greyson-Williams"" is excellent, this is the man who crafted the incredible score for Kingdom of Heaven and he is back with yet another great score that suits the movie perfectly, (also, the use of disco music is surprisingly good).
The Script is Perfect, the dialogue is not just a ""movie dialogue"", you believe that someone in that situation would talk and act like that, you sometimes feel that is inspired by a true story because everything seems so real.
The Cinematography is Incredible, Dariusz Wolski is a man who knows how to shoot a great film even if its not a ""Real Location"" He proved this with films like: The Walk, Prometheus, Pirates of the Caribbean and Now The Martian.
He's Style here is very similar to his style in Prometheus, anyone paying attention will know this is thee same cinematographer.
The Editing is Excellent (I'm Very Excited to see the Extended Cut when it comes out).
This is a very uplifting film that no one should miss.

4.5,"Really great. Not quite in Alien or Thelma and Louise league for me, but definitely one of Sir Riddles' finest. 

A big reason for this is the unexpected humour. I haven't read Andy Weir's book, so maybe the humour came from there. Riddles sure ain't know for it himself. And, granted, he sneaks yet ANOTHER gross-out ""extract-a-foreign-object-from-your-body-in-sci-fi-scene"" sequence into The Martian. But this isn't the typical grim, bleak, intense Riddles. The Martian is FILLED with wry, funny dialogue, observations, moments - and with a very optimistic vibe. Yes, the film is impeccably produced, perfectly cast (and WHAT a cast!!!), flawlessly performed (not a rotten apple here at all, but some standouts like Daniels) and just fantastically put together. Damon (the most affable megastar at the moment?) nails the lead role - essaying a tenacious, intelligent, funny, smart (smart ass) of a character with his usual relatable charm. I thought this film could've used a touch more resonance by showing exactly WHAT Mark Whatney was desperate to get home to (Family? Friends?) - he was a bit of a blank slate there. But the only REAL negative of ""The Martian"" is the slight overlength/pacing - the film drags a bit at the end of the second act/start of the third act, and it maybe validated a smidge more padding in the rear end (although arguably the shots under the main closing credits compensate for this).

Overall it's an extremely polished Hollywood product. In the league of recent space flicks, The Martian is perhaps not as heart-pounding suspenseful or kinetic or well-paced as Gravity. But it's certainly warmer and more accessible (if less philosophically ambitious) than Interstellar. A really great film. But what makes The Martian special is not just the light, humorous vein running through a very serious narrative - but the fact that that this is a story about fighting tooth and nail against the odds in a situation where NO violence is required. No superhero smackdowns, no die hard cop shoot-outs, no last minute knockouts. Yes, the film has few bursts of thrilling physical ""action"" - but it's not based (like most Hollywood blockbusters) on characters fighting each other. The film's optimistic (yet someone realistic) heart is derived from the suspense of simple survival, and rescue. The film reminded me of ""Castaway"" in many ways, although Damon doesn't have a volleyball like his Private Ryan saviour - instead he's got a laptop diary. Yet the vibe is not dissimilar. Instead of fish and coconuts we've got recycled shit and potato plants. Instead of ""man make fire"", we've got ""man make water"". Instead of building rafts, we've got building camera-systems. But unlike ""Castaway"", ""The Martian"" balances the stranded-man scenes with ""get him home"" rescue-plan scenes. All with fantastic ensemble work. All with decent to great suspense, and all with the sense that SAVING a person (even just ONE person) is a human quality that should always be valued. And these scenes - and Damon's - are all about scientific ingenuity. Using knowledge for survival instead of violence. Never giving up hope. Playing disco music. And always dropping one-liners along the way.

4.0,"Entertaining, dense, intriguing and emotionally powerful; showman filmmaker Ridley Scott's The Martian has delivered everything you would expect from a thrilling space rescue adventure and something you wouldn't, a good dose of humor. 

When a fierce windstorm rips through the site of a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is injured, left behind and presumed dead. But even to his own surprise, he survives.

Humor and problem solving his greatest tools, Watney resourcefully and determinately sets to devising a plan for survival. Addressing the myriad of challenges; Watney grows crops in an uninhabitable environment, makes contact with people light-years away and stays sane by talking to his ever present company of non-transmitting cameras. But can his ingenuity, wit and spirit hold out until help arrives?

Adapted closely from the most unlikely of sources, The Martian is a survival movie in the extreme, successfully teetering between a Gravity-esque universal epic and a Castaway intimate solitary endeavor. 

Set in the perfect tone (with only one slightly contrived geo-political misstep to detract from its cinematic value) the many strands the storyline never feel fragmented, no matter the distance between characters or believability of concept. 

Damon carries the film squarely his broad shoulders and although not embraced very often, the chocker block supporting cast (Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor to mention a few) is wonderfully strong. 

The Verdict: With grace and appealing irreverence, the documentation of a solitary dilemma has finally found a way to become uplifting.

4.5,"Matt Watney and his crew were given a mission to go to Mars. Once they went to Mars, they were attacked by a storm. One of the stones on Mars hit Matt Watney, causing him to fall down. The other people thought he was dead, so they left without him. But he wasn't. He was alive and alone in Mars. He tried to contact Nasa, but he knew it would take a long time. All he has is a station in Mars made by Nasa, some food(potatoes, cabbage and stuff) and his mechanical skills. He decided to cut the potatoes into a lot of pieces and grow it on Mars. It seems impossible, but he managed to do it alright. Soon, Nasa spotted some movement of objects on Mars, so they predict that Matt is still alive. They somehow managed to be in contact with each other. Nasa doesn't want the crew to come back to save Matt, but the crew wants to, so they defied Nasa's orders to save Matt, and it was a success.

I liked this movie because I like how much hope this Matt had whilst he was stuck in Mars. He believed that he will not die, and he tried really hard to survive. I'm also surprised how smart some astronauts in Nasa are, they seems to know everything about physics.

4.5,"*My Mark Watney Impression:
 
I refuse to be The First Man to Die on Mars.

I can just see my Wikipedia page now: 			      
 
Mark Watney (October 8, 1970 - October 2, 2015) 
was an American astronaut and 
the first person to die on Mars. 
During a severe Martian sandstorm, 
Watney was left for dead by his crew members.
However, by a miraculous twist of fate,
he survived the storm and saved his own life.
After noticing he was the last person on the planet, 
he threw himself a pity party, alas,
consuming most of the food supply 
in one bacchanal buffet.
He died the next morning from intestinal strain.

Whatever happens, I swear I won't have a crappy legacy.

""Um, this is Mark Watney, astronaut of Ares 3.
Status report: I'm still alive and I've decided not to die here. 
I can't communicate with Earth or my crew because 
the satellite dish fell off in the storm onto me. Yes, onto me. 
And lucky me...I survived. 
Of course, I'm still on a desert planet 
in a shelter designed to last a month. 
If anything breaks down, I could die in a Russian Roulette of ways 
ranging from suffocation to explosion. 
And if, with NASA's incredible engineering prowess, 
nothing breaks down, say, from a sandstorm...again,
my current food supply only lasts 400 sols, 
so the next Mars-bound mission would...arrive 4 years too late?
But this isn't my farewell speech because...
Lucky me, I'm a botanist.
I'll figure out a way to grow food and survive until NASA picks me up.
Unless the Disco music kills me first. 
Can you believe--it's the only music on the planet?""

*Warning: Spoilers below:

Every other week, we are saved
from disaster by a Caucasian man
built like an underwear model.
It is absolutely normal in movie reality
for one man to save the world, 
yet all those he saved 
don't even know he exists.

What would it be like for all of humanity 
to follow the journey of one man? 
One man whose only goal is to save himself--
to simply get by in life? Get by alone, 
in a desert that engulfs a whole planet, 
until a rescue mission reaches him 
from Earth, 225 million km away.
It's not completely hopeless.
He's got all of humanity on his side. 
Humankind united, rooting for him to survive.
The brightest minds collaborating
with the best resources at hand
in an international truce
to save one man. 
It's inspiring, to say the least. 

This movie loves humanity, and shows it.
Mark's crew volunteers to rescue him with zero hesitance, 
even as we see the loved ones they leave behind 
and know the risk they take in unplanned space travel.
Besides the Ares 3 crew, 
Rich Purnell, Mitch Henderson, NASA's JPL, Guo Ming and CNSA
are shown to be essential in the rescue of Mark for his return home. 
Glimpses of nutritionists and botanists, physicists and engineers-- 
a whole list of experts and bureaucrats
monitor one astronaut's health, offer insight and solutions, 
design his optimal plan of action.
And of course--every abiding taxpayer in financial support,
volunteers and resources from every country,
enormous crowds gathering worldwide to witness 
the historical event of Mark's rescue--
Mark Watney's journey is humanity at its best. 

The conflict isn't good guy versus bad guy.
The NASA Director is portrayed as an antagonist,
but he makes tough decisions and bears the responsibility. 
In such a high-risk gamble, would we make his same choices?
Everyone is on the same side, with differing opinions.
The uniting obstacle is the harsh planet itself, 
the common goal to help one man survive.
One man, representative of all humankind.

Mark Watney--he's got brains and brawn 
(until he runs low on potatoes).
He's resourceful, optimistic, funny! 
He deserves to be saved.

BUZZ. BUZZ. Alarm...clock? 
I don't want to get up, just let me...sleep.
Half-buried by sand...
	Oxygen level critical intones a smooth female voice. 
I sit up quickly. Sharp pain.
A steel antenna protrudes from the side of my body. 
I try to stand--the antenna jerks me back.
Attached to the antenna, a wire, trailing to a sandy satellite dish. 
Ripped off in the storm. So that's what struck me. 
And my crew...my crew left me for dead. 
Reasonable. 
I cut the wire with some pliers. 
The HAB isn't far, I can make it...

	Pressure level: stable the female voice soothes.
She's calm. Listen to her.
I take off as much of my spacesuit as I can. 
Breathe in, breathe out, out, out, PULL.
Blood flows through the unplugged hole...
Damn it. Something's still inside.
I can do this. I have to do this.
Staunch the blood, lie still, inject anesthetic.
Angle the mirror. Blood's flowing. 
Do it quick, before you faint.
Clamp one. Stretch the hole. 
Clamp two. Pull out...
a bullet-like metal bolt?
Hmm. It fits the antenna.

I'm experiencing everything 
Mark is seeing, thinking, doing.
His sweat and tear-streaked face, 
blood gushing in every movement,
and now...he's stapling his skin together.
Do I believe Mark Watney is stranded on Mars?
I believe he just performed a surgical procedure 
on himself because he had no other option.
By association, I believe he's on Mars.

The Martian is the only science fiction movie I have seen 
that I experience as if it were a true story. 
In a sense, it is a true story. 
Sometimes facts don't make a story true.

Fact one. The deadly sandstorm, 
crucial catalyst of the entire story, 
is not scientifically possible. 
Based on the physics of our universe
and what we know about Martian weather, 
the strongest ""sandstorm"" on Mars equals
the gentle breeze needed to fly a kite on Earth.
But does that fact make the sandstorm any less real? 
A Martian sandstorm is grasped by our reality
as the devastation of a tornado.
Not a single person has experienced wind on Mars, 
but everyone relates to a natural disaster on Earth.

Another sandstorm tears through the Hab's entrance, 
destroying Mark's potato crops. 
His loss is real to anyone who has worked hard
and lost because of something beyond their control.
Life goes on. Mark seals the Hab's entrance 
with a dubiously flimsy tarp.
When he counts his remaining potatoes 
as yet another storm rages in the background, 
whipping and buffeting the tarp,
he keeps losing count of the potatoes. 
His fear is real, and I understand it.
The impossible, recurring Martian sandstorms
relate the struggle of humans against nature.
In the choice between what is fact 
and what is real to the person watching the movie, 
choose realism--to tell a true story.

True stories, after all, challenge and relate to us the most.
Potatoes worth risking an explosion to grow. 
Potatoes grown from the most intimate fertilizer. 
One man on a parallel planet
where potatoes mean more to him 
than a million dollars mean to me. 
In my comfy first-world country, 
I throw away french fries when I'm full.
Potatoes in a world without ketchup.
Perspective.

The Martian approaches sci-fi like a captain's log
after a shipwreck on a deserted island. 
In the book, the author's passion shines greatest 
in Mark's every step of every problem, logged in great detail. 
It reads at times like a survival guide.
Precisely this attention to realism, in both movie and book, 
makes the impossible seem possible,
sparks curiosity and raises questions. 
People are wondering about science and space.

The Martian shines brilliantly in realism and faith in humanity.
It makes a science fiction concept a world away
feel like a news story that happened a month ago.
The Martian has crazy ideas that seem too crazy to be true, 
yet crazy ideas are the ones 
that change history and progress humankind.
For example-- 
the time is now: we can send astronauts to Mars.

Mark Watney the Martian challenges 
our time, mentality, and potential.
Most importantly, his story will influence our future.

The 'genius' plan seems almost obvious, which undermines the effort put into establishing the character as an uber-geek.",Gareth N,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 21, 2015",Gareth N,/user/id/784753305,RT,784753305,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/852370430/picture,The Martian
4.0,"Amante del genere Sci-Fi  e  galvanizzata dalla notizia che il ""mostro sacro"" Ridley Scott si sarebbe cimentato nell'adattamento cinematografico del romanzo ""L'uomo di Marte"" di Andy Weir mi sono precipitata a comprare il libro e ho atteso con trepidazione l'uscita del film.
Terminata con entusiasmo la lettura di questo fantastico esempio di Hard Sci-Fi ho cominciato a nutrire qualche perplessità sulla riuscita da parte di Scott di una bella e soprattutto fedele trasposizione sullo schermo. La mia immaginazione, temevo, si sarebbe potuta discostare di molto dalle caratteristiche narrative e soprattutto visive che caratterizzano le opere di Scott; ambientazioni cupe e quasi sempre notturne. Caratteristiche che  lo hanno reso il grande regista che è, ma  sarebbe riuscito a rispettate il clamore creato dal libro di Weir?
Dubbi, bisogna dirlo, alimentati anche dalle recenti delusioni che il cinema aveva portato nella mia vita di fanatica di genere, temevo in una nuova batosta sulla scia del blasonato ""Interstellar"" di Christopher Nolan, o del ""Prometheus"" dello stesso Scott. Film che sinceramente non hanno confermato le grandi aspettative che la pubblicità e i nomi illustri avevano creato.
Ridley Scott, invece, pare che sia finalmente tornato in sé. Grazie all'atmosfera del pianeta rosso esce con stile  dai canoni che hanno sempre caratterizzato i suoi capolavori e finalmente ci regala un po' di luce. Seguendo fedelmente la trama del libro dona allo spettatore l'intera gamma di emozioni che vanno dalla paura alla felicità, trascinando ed entusiasmando fino alla fine. 
Durante una missione su Marte il botanico Mark Watney (Matt Damon), viene investito dal palo di un'antenna per le comunicazioni mentre una forte tempesta di sabbia e detriti costringe ad abortire la spedizione, creduto morto dal resto dell'equipaggio della missione NASA Ares III, viene lasciato sul pianeta rosso. Watney, ferito ma ancora vivo, si ritrova da solo a dover sopravvivere su di un pianeta ostile impossibilitato a comunicare con la Terra. Senza perdersi d'animo inizia subito a provvedere, grazie alle sue vaste conoscenze scientifiche, alla mancanza di cibo e acqua. Ogni suo calcolo, ogni sua mossa, viene registrata tramite un video diario che permette allo spettatore di capire le scelte di sopravvivenza del protagonista. Mark deve riuscire a sopravvivere per almeno quattro anni, momento in cui spera di poter essere salvato dalla missione NASA Ares IV. Come può salvarsi la pelle un botanico su Marte? Ovviamente coltivando una piccola piantagione di patate! La preparazione accademica di questo moderno Robinson Crusoe gli permette di risolvere anche il problema della mancanza di comunicazione con la Terra e grazie al superamento di questo ostacolo,  la NASA e addirittura l'Agenzia Spaziale Cinese si adoperano per fare in modo di riportare Watney sano e salvo a casa. Condito con grande senso dello humor e tanta Disco Music, il film non annoia e riesce con maestria a colmare le difficoltà che ci sarebbero potute essere nella comprensione di calcoli matematici e reazioni chimiche. Scott  non delude affatto e torna a splendere grazie anche ad un cast stellare, da Jessica Chastain (capitano Lewis) a Kristen Wiig (PR della NASA), a Sean Bean e Jeff Daniels, fino a Kate Mara, Donald Glover e Michael PeÑa .
Sicuramente un film che entrerà a far parte del cult di Fantascienza. Il cinema viene messo al servizio della scienza e viceversa, tanto che il ragazzo seduto vicino a me ha affermato di avere di nuovo voglia di mettersi a studiare.

3.5,"Sigh. I so wanted to love this movie. Alas, The Martian novel was so much better than the film.  The film was just pretty good, imho.

*******There be SPOILERS and NITPICKs below this point. *******

Mark Watney, Martian astronaut marooned on Mars, was portrayed well enough by Matt Damon. The pacing of the film was just okay as the novel's pacing so much better isolated you alongside Mark Watney on the red planet and intimately connected you with his humorous personality, individual and team problem solving ingenuity and the imperfect perseverance of the human mind!

My pet peeves about the movie include the silly treatment of the ""f-word""...jeez, this is the 21st century folks.. ..Watney's opening line in the novel was awesome ""I'm pretty much fucked. That's my considered opinion. Fucked.""  Worse, the supporting cast's goofy response to Watney's language was Hollywood profit making farce at work.  

I was pleased that the supporting cast of scientists, engineers and astronauts generally had down-to-earth humanness to them (notwithstanding Purnell's slapstick performance which totally dumbed down the Purnell maneuver (Troy, you should have stuck with Community).  

More nitpicks that sabotaged my enjoyment: 

The big chunks of the Martian windstorm were especially annoying, as they were obviously rendered for a 3D ""experience.""  Immerse me in a real Martian dust storm please!  Kudos for showing a bit of Martian lightning, though.

The digging up of the Mars rover came across to me as slipshod.  A big mound appeared right beside Watney after he discovers the parachute rigging, and then after a digging cutaway, the rover is revealed as even taller than the mound was.  Disbelief unsuspended again!

The Martian landscape was done fairly well.  Alas the treatment of Mars gravity and Mars atmospheric conditions were poorly simulated and further took me out of the experience.  (fyi 100mph winds on Mars have the force of a 1mph wind on Earth)

Frankly though, the real missing piece was befriending Watney along the way.  The film utterly fails at creating a deep connection between the viewer and Mark Watney.  On the other hand, the novel maroons you with Watney in his plight much longer and much more intimately than the film does.  Watney's wit is barely introduced in the film  No ""pirate ninjas,"" no potato meets vitamin banter, no obeisance to duct tape!!!. ( ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped."" )

Elsewise, I kind of liked the 3d effects on Mars, in space and even the on the digital overlays; however, I found the brightness of the film suffered greatly (at Movie Tavern Collegeville)...and to be honest I wish 3d would go away if movie theaters can't implement it correctly.

Overall, sure, if you are a sci-fi fan, go see the Martian, it's cool, but do yourself a big favor and read Andy Weir's awesome novel to take you wholly to the red planet (Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars is another wonderful fictional treatment of Mars (and it's colonization)

I liked the premise and science of the film, and some of the characterization, and I thought it was formatted decently for a novel adaptation, but overall I could see this story working better as novel.  I feel like the novel would have thrived on the small details of science and emotion that just couldn't be translated onto film.  It felt like this film was trying hard to be great and that it was getting close but it just couldn't push through and get there.

5.0,"I'm not sure what it says about the current state of cinema that I was genuinely surprised by how happy ""The Martian"" made me. Matt Damon bleeds optimism as the title character and is a pleasure to watch. But what really sticks is that fact that every character's motivations are easy to cheer. There are no adversaries, cynics, or villains and nobody even hints at cause for distrust. The effect is that you, as a viewer, feel like more of a participant on the exciting rescue mission than a witness to it. Neat stuff.   

The movie also has a very subtle, critical foundation that's easy to overlook. Ridley Scott presents the story in a way that always directs our attention beyond the fact that humans made it to Mars in the first place. In fact, that accomplishment feels pedestrian - not because it's a fictional movie and we've seen Mars on screen before, but instead because Ridley Scott clearly thinks that we're overdue for and highly capable of real shot at the Red Planet. We need more movies that inspire like this one does.",Christian C,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 19, 2015",Christian C,/user/id/781835588,RT,781835588,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/14100091/picture,The Martian
4.5,"If the jubilant 80s soundtrack and snappy wisecracks of last year's lively space romp, 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' revived the sanguine sci-fi, then Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' has taught it to walk. In what could have easily echoed Warner Bros.' award-winning space disaster epic, 'Gravity,' 'The Martian,' rather, not only evokes an optimistic outlook on space exploration but also injects a rebellious dose of realism and humor despite its eccentric protagonist being stranded 140 million miles from the planet we call home.

4.5,"""The Martian"" is Ridley Scott's best film since ""Thelma and Louise,"" which might not be saying much but speaks to the fact that even a 77-year-old dog like Scott, mostly relegated to junky hackwork and FX-heavy spectacle in recent years can still bust out a real winner when given a solid script.

And that's exactly what ""The Martian"" is: Solid. Clear, un-fussy, journeyman direction; a classic movie-star-charisma performance from Damon in the vein of a Gregory Peck or a Cary Grant; a cause-and-effect story structure that makes a virtue of the constant stream of science-jargon-exposition... Perhaps there's nothing spectacular in regards to any one element, but everything is simply on-point, like a working engine that runs smooth and efficiently.

It's meat-and-potatoes, back-to-basics filmmaking-- which in and of itself can be considered a refreshing virtue in this day and age-- but it's all in service of the kind of romantic family adventure film in the Spielberg/Amblin mold that Abrams and Nolan were aiming for (and failed to capture) with their ""Super 8"" and ""Interstellar."" 

And it all comes down to the little details; the small things that don't draw attention to themselves, but nevertheless exist in the margins of the story while brightening the film with personalty and beauty: that great drama (and specifically, the FX-heavy sci-fi blockbuster genre) doesn't require death or mass destruction; that there's no villain and everybody has good intentions and is good at their job; that the cast is incredibly diverse in both gender and race; that science and exploration is regarded as a beautiful ideal, made possible through humanity's unity; that the day is saved by critical thinking and teamwork, rather than through violence or the actions of a lone hero; and most importantly, that optimism and hope trump cynicism and hopelessness every time. 

When irony, pessimism, and darkness reign, it's the romantics that risk looking foolish and cheesy for their staunch belief in the supreme power of beauty that are truly edgy and rebellious... And that, in a nutshell, is ""The Martian.""",Trevor R,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 19, 2015",Trevor R,/user/id/910711026,RT,910711026,,The Martian

I totally got into it in the beginning...I loved the concept, the actors, the effects.  Some funny bits, and edge of your seat moments.

Or, the big buildup to the supply ship lift-off...the celebration...the result...saw that coming a mile away. Throw in unnecessary disco tracks to sell CD and make more money and they've managed to make what could have been a fantastic movie into an eh.

The painfully stupid things were the untethered astronaut sans jet-pack adding drama as he went from panel to panel...almost missing.  Of course, the astronaut with the jet-pack is tethered...why?

4.5,"Surely, Ridley Scott belongs in the pantheon of directors when it's all said and done.  His grasp of directing science fiction has always been his forte dating as far back to Blade Runner and Alien up to Prometheus, and now, The Martian.

With a few after effects and some cool set builds, Scott manages to drop Mars into our laps right in our own backyard in Jordan where this was filmed.  Just like Matt Damon's character, the audience gets a great feel for just how isolated someone can be on a planet where nobody lives.  Sweeping landscapes with craters, cliffs and sand stretch as far as the eye can see in The Martian.  

Which brings us to our starring role of Mark Watney.  Damon plays it loose with some quality humor bringing a real down-to-earth (haha) feel for the character.  We've had movies before about Mars where too often the lead roles feel overtly serious and pessimistic.  Here, we finally get someone we feel relatable with because of Watney's desire to actually succeed/stay alive.

The supporting cast is just as star studded, too.  Jeff Daniels brings his Newsroom character to the movie as the no-nonsense NASA director.  Chiwetel Ejiofor is the frantic, heart-on-his-sleeve second in command.  The crew, while not all recognizable outside of Chastain, Pena and Mara, really let their distinct character's personalities shine through in the brief screen time they get.  That I feel is more a result from the fabulous acting of its actors than the writing of script.

So here's my only few gripes that keep it from top billing: There was a CNN reporter so determined to be written into the movie, I could have completely done without any of his narration in the climax of the film.  The audience didn't need it, and quite frankly, to go along with my next point, it distracted from the tension in that climactic final 20 minutes.

Here's the best description I can say about 'The Martian'.  It's not as serious or gripping as Gravity.  It's not as flashy or unreal as Interstellar.  Where the first is a movie you hope would never happen to anyone, to the second being a movie you actually hope some day might happen (when it comes to the technology and time travel and black hole silliness), The Martian is legitimately a film you could see happening somewhere in the (near) future, and that's why watching it and rooting for Mark Watney is so enjoyable in the end.",Lane Z,False,True,False,False,4.5,"Oct 19, 2015",Lane Z,/user/id/906836279,RT,906836279,,The Martian

4.5,"In a not-so-distant future, when NASA is still around to send a 3rd manned mission to Mars for research, a freak storm rips through the station as the crew desperately try to abort and escape its ruthless fury. Blown away by flying debris, one crew member goes missing and is tentatively presumed dead as the Captain makes the call to take off. However, the grieving crew and shocked humans back home are completely unaware of Mark Watney's chance survival. 
Thereon, science fiction borders reality in a race against time and depleting resources as Ridley Scott ('Aliens', 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal', 'Black Hawk Down', 'American Gangster', 'Prometheus') comes to form after a couple of recent disappointments such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Exodus'. Along with a career best performance by Matt Damon, 'The Martian' descends into a zone that makes it far more entertaining than Michael Bay's space adventures but not as personal and deeply engrossing as Interstellar. It makes for an engaging, funny and credible adventure as it was set out to be in Andy Weir's best-selling novel, adapted here by Drew Goddard;s ('Lost', 'Netflix's Daredevil') entertaining screenplay. This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right. 

	18 Sols have passed since Mark Watney (Matt Damon) stapled his wound after the storm and his crew's departure. He has calculated his rations, improvised on the limited resources and come up with an survival plan that involves generation of water and cultivation of potatoes - on Mars. Soon enough, the scientists at NASA notice movements around Mark's station through images and reach out to him through the Pathfinder's camera. As the communication links are established, plans are set in motion to rescue Mark even though its execution will challenge several development and launch teams on Earth and himself physically and mentally to survive up to 4 more years. 
The scientific ideas are comprehensible, making Mark's improvisations with his resources all the more credible. It isn't just about his existence in an inhospitable environment but about pushing one's capabilities and resources to the utmost levels in order to prolong survival. Rescue being an uncertain number of months away, Mark has to keep recalculating provisions while maintaining the constant, entertaining communication. Those lighter moments in such trying times are what make The Martian such a good film compared to the darkness in Prometheus. 
Time, in essence, is the only villain in this story. 

	Jessica Chastain plays Captain Lewis, who struggles to get to terms with her decision to abort the mission. She convincingly portrays the compassion for her crew and audacity when she must alter the mission itself. Michael Pena's comic timing is always an asset in a film and as Martinez, he keeps things light and relatable. Kate Mara and the rest of the crew members do an adequate job while some of the stronger performances are by actors back on Earth, including Jeff Daniels as NASA's overly cautious director Sanders, Benedict Wong as the director of JPL who leads a team that is tasked with achieving the impossible, Sean Bean as Mitch who heads the mission with complete dedication to the safety of the crew and of course, Chiwetel Ejiofor's Vincent Kapoor, the engineer whose diligent efforts in tracking Watney led to the agency's serious consideration for launching a rescue mission. His, is perhaps the best performance among the supporting cast. 
As Watney explains to us, although he is just addressing the camera for recording purposes, the math behind supplies rationing, potato cultivation or simply, the odds of his survival with every changing circumstance, we are completely engaged in his efforts and genuinely want him off the red planet. As an expert botanist whose wit comes in handy in most of the scientific applications on Mars, Matt Damon delivers his most compelling performance that makes science and engineering more entertaining. That is precisely where The Martian succeeds. 

The film's ability to convey the scientific and human challenges while being stranded on Mars, but with easy understanding and witty humor that keeps the grip on the audience while they witness a miraculous rescue attempt that is planned and executed to a meticulous degree. Against the backdrop of disco music, Watney gently trudges along the Martian landscape in his rover as the engineers at NASA refer to his rescue mission as Elrond. The nerd quotient here is at a sublime level that doesn't overpower the narrative. The cinematography and visual effects simply make Jordan look more credible as the surface of Mars while the sfx in space are refined enough for certain thrilling scenes. Technically, Ridley Scott has abstained for over-burdening the entertaining narrative with unnecessary special effects. He relies heavily upon Drew Goddard's screenplay of Weir's book and on Matt Damon, whom America has repeatedly sent on missions only to lose him. The Martian is a complete exercise on problem solving. You solve one and another one surfaces. You solve that and there's a new one. Up until you solve enough to just stay alive. A rescue is only a fool's hope or a miracle. In Matt Damon's case, we'd rather keep sending him to faraway places just so we can watch him being rescued again.

4.5,"Almost everything that can be said about this movie has been said by either critics or audiences, but I will try to give my opinion.  First of all I want to say this is one of the best Matt Damon performances I've seen. All the other performances were good also, but I felt one of the astronauts in particular was lacking.

I thought the setting of Mars was greatly filmed and the cinematography was excellent.  If I ever film a movie I want my wide shots to be like this.

Sadly, I didn't notice the score at all and some of the conflicts midway through the movie felt forced.  

Once again Ridley Scott has impressed me with his shooting of space. This is one of his best films in a while and thankfully so much better than Exodus.

This specific movie is intense right out of the gate and keeps you involved the entire time despite it's journal like storytelling.

4.5,"When I heard about this movie I was excited. But when I heard Ridley Scott was the Director..I was truly eager to see what this film brought to the table. 
And true to form, it brought much to the table, and so much to ponder over. 
At its very core, it's a drama that focuses on the human spirit and endurance. But, whilst being that.  The Martian also manages to educate in all things science related, without being something the average viewer could not easily digest.
I talk about this movie, using many references to food & eating. The Martian also has so much hanging on the things that us mere humans need in order to live...water and food. How would you survive on a desolate planet like Mars with not enough food or water, until you were rescued? Well, that very question is very much central to this movie. 
But, this film is very much about people. Their resilience..drive and determination.
Matt Damon was made for this role. You feel his fear, joy, urgency, and dismay. It's Matt that makes this movie so good.

4.0,"After several misses in the last 5 years, Ridley Scott returns to form with the exciting and surprisingly funny 'The Martian'. As we've all seen from the trailers and tv ads, Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, an astronaut left for dead on the red planet. Using his limited resources and intelligent problem solving skills, Watney does what he can to stay alive long enough for the next planned mission to Mars.
This is intelligent science fiction at it's finest. The characters don't get much development, but just knowing they are astronauts and work for NASA makes us know that these are smart, resourceful individuals. There's no hesitancy with any of the characters - they're aware of the situation and they do their math and problem solving, thinking outside the box and do whatever they can to communicate with one another and figure a way to get Watney back home.
Great production design - the suit worn by Watney and the other astronauts  looks like an alternate design of the suits worn in Scott's 'Prometheus', but does look like something to be worn on Mars in the next 20 years or so.

4.5,"There has been a lot of good space movies in the past few years but they were  all to sci-fi. Ridley Scott and Andy Weir break the non existent rules! On with the review: The Martian is one of this year's best movies by far and is on the fast track to the Oscars. This is due to its realistic look at the beautifully horrifying future of space exploration. The film has a simple but new plot, gorgeous special effects, and fantastic acting. The plot has some of the best flow and theming I have ever seen. Each plot line fits together flawlessly and is reminiscent of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (one of my favorite movies.) I enjoy the break from the idea of defeating a villain, like most sci-fi movies had this year, and turning the enemy into the challenge of survival. The visual effects don't look like visual effects which means the VFX team did their job extremely well. The acting is fantastic and extremely human (like most films during Oscar season) which is expressed in the short bursts of humor and the differences between logistics and courageousness. Matt Damon's performance as Mark Watney  is one of the greatest I have seen in my whole life, especially the rush of emotions he feels during the finale. He had better get an Oscar for it. My one problem with the whole film is the lengthy ending. It drags on a little to long in my opinion and could have been easily abbreviated. At least they didn't play disco music! Oh wait, they did. The soundtrack is fun and comprised of disco songs which add a very humorous air to some scenes. In general, this is one of the greatest films this year, contains a fantastic cast, and is an interesting look at the trip to Mars. I definitely recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like space travel.

3.5,"Better Beginning Than Ending

I just saw both ""The Martian"" and ""Jurassic World"" this week. And, here are two movies whose first halves are better than their second halves.

The setup of ""The Martian"" is very good! Stranded on Mars, Matt Damon must use his science background to engineer his way out of dying on the red planet before a return mission can come and get him.

(SPOILERS BEGIN) His plan goes well, and he meets with setbacks, which you would expect. Meanwhile, everyone on Earth tries to figure on a way to come and rescue him. Everything goes well, in that respect. But, the ending gets a little crazy, including a space- based ""Gravity""-type action sequence that defeated the decidedly better science-based opening. (END SPOILERS)

Ridley Scott does have a return to form here, after the muddled ""Prometheus."" Scott has always seemed at home with science-fiction, and I hope that he continues making more sci fi.

The acting is very good, especially by Damon, who must carry the film by design. The film score is pretty routine, which like ""Prometheus"" doesn't help the film like it should.

The cinematography is fine. I did have a problem with the visual effects. Those set on Mars are okay enough, even though they occasionally lack polish. But, the space-based ones look worse than those in the superior 2000 entry ""Red Planet."" That's odd, and might be a reflection of budgetary restrictions. ILM is on board here, but is a minor player. The effects seem more suited to a higher-budget Science Channel program.

With Scott Kelly doing his year in space at the moment on the International Space Station, it is especially odd to not see The Milky Way in the background while the ships are moving though space. As seen from Kelly's photographs, our galaxy should be very prominent, and really impossible to miss. Instead, we just get black, with a few scattered stars.

So, a good, but mixed entry. I am going to listen to the audiobook, and it should be interesting to see how that turns out compared to the film.

4.0,"Combine the best parts of Cast Away, Apollo 13, and Bill Nye the Science Guy, and you get The Martian. It's an uplifting story of the human spirit that's going to make you want to be a scientist. The humor is unexpected but welcome, and keeps a lengthy movie from being boring. While it does drag at a few points in its 2 hour 22 minute runtime, there's more than enough to keep you interested. Matt Damon's performance is his best in a long time. He's intelligent, charming, and inspiring as astronaut/botanist Mark Watney.

4.0,"Ridley Scott is a director that has a pretty impressive resume as it is extremely extensive (from a ""Barry Lyndon"" wannabe to science fiction epics) and it is known for being a versatile director that can craft highly visually striking films that offer some interesting conversations: They can be incredible and iconic (""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"",  ""Thelma & Louis""), memorable but flawed (""Gladiator"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""American Gangster""), polarizing (""Prometheus"", ""Legend"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"") or downright failures (""The Counselor"", ""Robin Hood"", ""A Good Year"", ""1492"",""Hannibal""). But in 2015, he returned to the genre that made his career, and arguably the one he is most talented at. So the question is: In what category does ""The Martian"" fall into? 
Ares 3, a manned mission to Mars, suffers from Mars´s climate so they are forced to abandon their mission, but one astronaut is presumed dead and left behind. Thus beginning a survival story of worldly proportions as a man is forced to use his creativity and intelligence to survive alone in mostly unresearched planet. 
A way to describe this film is as an insane mixture of a ""Robinson Crusoe meets Gravity"" plot, a ""Moon"" like atmosphere, some ""Life of Pi"" visuals and type of themes, and  a"" Prometheus"" style of directing. So as you can see, the ambition of this film is extremely high and thankfully Ridley Scott pulled this task perfectly. ""The Martian"" is a film that has solid performances from its entire cast, with Matt Damon providing his most charismatic performance to date; gorgeous looking visuals (as expected from Scott), seamless CGI, a surprising amount of actually amusing comedy, a tone that knows when it needs to be tense and when to be comedic, a masterfully crafted sense of wonder, a peculiar use of music that shockingly works, the character interactions feel genuine, the solidly written screenplay, the messages are relevant and are easy to relate to (thus why a lot of people love it), the cinematography is beautiful, and Scott´s directing is perfect for this story (all the mistakes he made in ""Prometheus"" are corrected here). But with all that said, I have mayor issues with this film. The pacing is inconsistent, at times it goes extremely fast but suddenly it drastically slows down for just to make more space for jokes. The ending is ridiculous compared to all the realistic feeling the film had, the supporting characters lack personality and not a single character counts with some development (even Mat Damon´s character never changes). And finally Scott´s directing is so focused on the landmark and the comedy that some interesting dramatic ideas are never touched, which is a huge wasted opportunity. 
""The Martian"" is a light tone gorgeously looking film that is funny and solidly tense. While it has some flaws, it offers a unique experience of wonder and excitement. Not only it is a highlight in Scott's career but it is also one of the best science fiction films of 2010s.

4.0,"Yes, I am a big Matt Damon fan. He is an A lister and he can
carry most any movie. However, his newest movie ""The Martian""
just didn't float my boat when I saw previews probably because
I'm not a big Sci-Fi guy.  Also, I have this weird phobia that
2 word movies starting with ""The"" are not good (History shows
I'm very wrong on my theory.

Stumbling around rottentomatoers.com, out of a corner of my eye
I critic and audience rating both over 90% for The Martian.  That
is a crazy high # and was the ""tell"" to me that I had to go.

Despite a running time well over 2 hours (141 minutes), I had to 
check out this film.  The trailers shared a simply story of Damon,
on a Mars space mission, is left behind, assumed dead, in a terrible
surface storm.

Of course he surveys and the story is about the journey to establish
communication; create a survivable situation (food, water, air, shelter
& more); and figure out a plan to get rescued.

The measured step by step approach to solving endless problems by both
Damon and the rescuers really works.  There is no side stories, no drama,
no relations.  Just ""professional"" focus on the task at hand by Damon and
the space community (including China).

Hard to explain why this movie worked, but it REALLY WORKED.  Engaging, no
flashy, emphasized advance problem solving & leadership by both sexes and
of all ages.  Plus no violence, sex, bad language etc...just plain old movie
tension.

This movie was sort of like watching a reality TV show where you just knew
things were going to crash and burn.  Yet, the professional skills of the
astronauts and the NASA community exhibited brilliance in their effort to
return their astronaut home.

Just a clue of the likability of this film was that the entire audience
stayed for the entire credits (no outtakes) just respect.  This was TOP SHELF

4.0,"Based upon Andy Weir's nuts-and-bolts scientific ""what if"" tale, The Martian is the movie equivalent of Apollo 13 crossed with Cast Away. Just far less personable volleyballs. But there are potatoes. Space potatoes.

After a powerful storm on Mars forces NASA's crew to flee, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left behind. He wakes up hours later, shrapnel in his gut, and retreats back to the Mars mission base. He has to survive close to two years of he has any hope of being rescued on the hostile world. Before that, he has to establish some kind of communication with NASA, and even before that he has to somehow grow food in the arid Martian soil. Back at home, NASA is debating their limited options to bring back Watney and whether or not they should tell his cremates that he survived. 

In conversations with my friend and critical colleague Ben Bailey, he said that The Martian was the opposite of Gravity, a film he subsequently loathed, because it was smart people making smart decisions. There is an inherent enjoyment watching intelligent people tackle and persevere over daunting challenges, and this sets up The Martian for lots of payoffs and satisfaction. We see both sides of the problem and it provides even more opportunities for challenges and payoffs. Naturally the stuff on Mars is more compelling because of its extreme dangers and isolation, but the Earth scenes are also enjoyable as the NASA determines the soonest they might reach their lost astronaut. Just like the similarly themed Apollo 13, there are challenges to be overcome and the solutions are not without risk themselves. I enjoyed how the screenplay kept throwing out new obstacles; just when you think you can breath for a while the status quo is upset again. The slew of new obstacles doesn't feel contrived either but rather realistic setbacks. It's a wonderful storytelling structure that constantly keeps things moving forward and ramps up the urgency. As a result, we don't ever feel safe right until the climax, and even then you're still sweating it out because of all the complications and adjustments. 

It's revitalizing to watch a movie that treats science with a sense of reverence. Mark Watney endures in the most hostile of environments through his ingenious use of the resources he has because of his understanding of science and math. Just as MacGyver proved there was something satisfying about watching a guy make a bomb out of a toilet paper tube, some chewing gum, and a bobby pin, it's entirely enjoyable watching Watney think his way out of problems, and this starts early on. Watney's first problem after he regains consciousness is to remove an embedded piece of shrapnel in his gut. The scene plays in a methodical fashion without any obtrusive edits, allowing the full task to settle in with the audience. The man has to perform surgery on himself and dig inside himself, and if he doesn't get this done soon, sepsis might set in (no doctors without borders here). From there, the situation only gets more serious as Watney's food supply, even when generously rationed, will only last a fraction of the time it would take NASA to send a rescue team. He has to grow food on an alien planet. That itself could be its own movie, a glossy crossover special from the SyFy Channel and the Home and Garden network. This is a survival story that doesn't rely upon coincidence or some sort of divine intervention but on the understanding and admiration of science and its possibilities. Though America's favorite astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says that in this movie universe, all the science decisions are being made by science professionals rather than, you know, politicians who adamantly open ignorant statements with, ""I'm not a scientist.""

Another aspect I wasn't quite expecting but took hold of me is how uplifting The Martian turns out to be. It's a celebration of human endeavor and particularly cooperation, as the United States reaches out to other nations for assistance. Watching the determined souls risk their lives to retrieve one fallen man is the kind of thing that represents the best in us. Sure, there's something to be said about the fact that it's one prized American life that countries are spending billions of not trillions of dollars to rescue and perhaps that money would be better spent helping more lives on Earth. There's also the curious fact that the world has spent a ton of money rescuing Matt Damon in movies. From Saving Private Ryan, to Interstellar, and now The Martian, we seem to value Damon above all else. 

This isn't exactly a one-man show with half of the running time flashing back to Earth but Damon's star quality and acting chops makes it so you don't mind being marooned with this man. Watney's recorded messages are a slick way to deal with the internal thinking of its protagonist while giving the character more opportunities to charm thanks to a rich sense of gallows-level humor. At no point is Mark Watney flippant about his unique predicament but his sense of humor goes a long way to further engender the audience's good will. He's not moping and having existential crises; he's getting to work, and it's through the problem solving that we get to know this character, his ingenuity, his personality, his fears, and his distaste for disco music. Damon steers clear from playing the character too large and bearing his soul as the metaphorical representative for all of humanity and its place in the cosmos. He's just one guy who happens to be lost millions of miles from his home planet, and he's making the best of it. 

Being a Ridley Scott film, naturally the film is downright impeccable from a technical standpoint. The photography is great, communicating the frightening and awe-inspiring scope of the alien topography, especially when compared to maps for scale. The visuals find ways to further help communicate Watney's dilemma and diminished resources. Scott's visual sensibilities are so naturally attuned to developing tension. I was holding my breath at times from the suspense of certain sequences even though I long assumed that Watney would make it back home safe and sound. A scene with a desperate need for duct tape was a real nail-biter. There isn't a bad performance amongst the star-studded cast of actors who must have been grateful for even a tiny morsel of screen time. I have no idea what Kirsten Wiig really does in this movie as the NASA PR person besides fold her arms in rooms, but hey, she's there, along with Donald Glover as a socially awkward physicist. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) gets to pour over the regret of leaving a friend behind, Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber Too) gets to once more practice his skill of being an authoritarian blowhard he honed from The Newsroom, and I even was able to tolerate Kate Mara (Fantastic Four), so that's something. 

The Martian is a natural crowd-pleaser. It's engineered from the start to engage an audience with its survival thrills, present a series of increasing payoffs with new challenges and solutions, and by the end of our journey we're treated to a rousing finish that carries a poignancy and sense of inspiration about the best in all of us, what can be accomplished through grit and cooperation and sacrifice. It's a movie that let's the science of survival be the ultimate star, with Damon serving as a handsome host to guide us through the marvels of the universe and duct tape. When dealing with the vastness of space and the vulnerability of human life, it's easy to feel insignificant in comparison, but that's where the human will to endure and to work together comes in and reconfirms the possibilities of the collective inhabitants of this giant blue orb. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller, a potent human drama, and one of the best times you can have at the movies.

4.5,"Well it's official ladies and gentlemen!  After a series of misfires and one outright disaster, Ridley Scott is back!  This time with The Martian, a straightforward, feel good, entertaining space survival film with one foot in believable hard science fiction.  The plot is focused on an accidentally marooned astronaut, played by Matt Damon, who really hopes you forgot his character in Interstellar and how he almost ruined that particular movie.  Facing daunting odds in order to survive, he must in his own words ""science the shit out of this.""  It is that line that captures the essence of this picture - the idealism of scientific knowhow triumphing over all tribulations.  During the time we spend with our protagonist, we learn much about him - that he's brilliant but slightly overconfident.  Intelligent, but crass.  A thorough planner, but reactive.  Engaging, but lonely.  And loneliness is what defines much of that time.  Mars is both dangerous and beautiful, and it's the first time watching a movie that I find myself wanting to visit it.  

But we are not micro focused on Matt Damon, as the story also displays the scientists and bureaucrats at NASA and the rest of the crew on the Hermes.  There is a massive collaborative effort to, yes, save Matt Damon again.  These scenes are quite reminiscent of Ron Howard's modern classic Apollo 13.  Jeff Daniels is quite comfortable as the bureaucratic director of NASA, and here he plays a slightly more self-absorbed version of his character from The Newsroom.  He is the closest thing the film has to a villain, but even then he is largely concerned with the safety of the astronauts and the integrity of NASA itself.  The Martian doesn't need a villain or melodrama to make itself more interesting.  Sean Bean has a nice turn as the voice of reason, and shout outs to Kristin Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor for colorful supporting roles.  And of course, Jessica Chastain is perfect as a steely-eyed mission commander struggling with guilt that she inadvertently started this disaster.  

I'd be remiss not to mention the wonderful amount of humor to be had, to the point that it was almost a comedy.  What I particularly loved was that it was not overly quirky or the kind of knock-knock, wink-wink ironic humor that is found in most blockbuster tentpoles these days.  And it helps considering the serious subject matter and it manages not to detract from the experience.  And the visuals were exactly what they needed to be - the right amount of locations, practical sets, and CGI to make it look real and believable.  Realism is one of the key factors this movie works, and the collaboration with NASA shows how scientifically plausible it is.  The design of the spacesuits, the Mars habitat, and even the sleek looking Hermes spaceship are all based on existing or planned NASA designs.  As where the also excellent Gravity was a more emotionally satisfying film - beautiful, moody, and downright spiritual - The Martian is the smartest and most accessible entry in this particular genre and it succeeds with its believability, humor, likeable characters, and general positive attitude towards space exploration.  Those being ample reasons why I not only recommend this, but make it required viewing to my loyal readers.

P.S. Hey Mass Effect fans!  If Mass Effect were ever able to get a film adaptation within the next decade or so, and the filmmakers decided to bravely double down on a Female Commander Shepard, you have to admit, Jessica Chastain might be our woman.

5.0,"THE MARTIAN brings us the best film of the year so far. After a few misses (Robin Hood, Prometheus, Exodus: Gods and Kings) Ridley Scot returns to form with this epic story of Mark Watney. 

After reading (and absolutely loving) the novel by Andy Weir, I went into the theater with extremely high expectations and the film delivered on all of them. Matt Damon was the perfect casting as he portrayed Watney with all of the wit, humor, and optimism that was he showed in the book. Damon's performance makes Mark Watney one of the most relatable  characters in recent cinema. 

The supporting cast was also outstanding, from Jeff Daniels, Kristin Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA scientists, to Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan, Michael Pena and Kate Mara in space, every character was as I pictured them while reading the book. 

The characters being loyal to the book is not what makes the performances good though. What makes them excellent is the way that they are written and portrayed. The chemistry between the members of the crew of the Aries 3 demonstrated the way that a group of people would be after spending do many months with no one but each other for company. 

What was so amazing about THE MARTIAN was that it was not only able to keep the the audience enthralled with simply one character on Mars, but that those aspects of the film were the most enjoyable. It took what could have been such a depressing idea, and turned it into a thrilling and humor filled mission of hope. 

Also, the Earth aspect showed ther realism of actually having a man stranded in space. I demonstrates the fact that as much as we would want to, it is not necessarily possible to do what ever it takes to save someone. There is a lot of paperwork and weighing of scenarios that make it difficult to decide if it is even possible to accomplish such a feat. However, in the third act, there is a portion of about 25 minutes that  are spent on Earth that feels unnecessary and drawn out for a 2 and a half hour movie. 

Further, THE MARTIAN is a beautiful movie to watch. The visuals are absolutely outstanding. The vast, dusty and barren Mars landscape made it feel more like an actual character than simply a setting. For a second I had to step back and remember that it was not actually filmed on Mars!

The only reason i would rank the book slightly higher than the movie is that there was some events left out (I know how cliche that sounds). In the book there were several more instances and events in which it made me feel more danger for Watney. However I do not blame the movie for this as it would draw the run time out even more.

Everything about this movie hits; The story, the characters, the performances the humor, the visuals all come together to create a breathtaking film that is just as good as the novel in which it is based.

2.5,"Made by and for the ""Mythbusters"" crowd by way of Facebook's ""I Fucking Love Science"" page, ""The Martian"" stumbles because it wants to have its cake and eat it too: on the one hand, it delves deeply (and unnecessarily, from a narrative standpoint) into scientific minutiae when problems confront our heroes (or when exposition is used to fill screen time); on the other hand, it completely elides rather more significant issues, like ""Once we get back to Mars to get Matt Damon, how are we actually going to get him onto the ship?"". 

You know, the sort of thing that would likely have been worked out in detail by real, ""hard"" scientists before it ever reached the ears of a Mission Director or the Head of NASA, but in ""The Martian"" is consigned to a wacky young quirky scientist straight out of a ""Big Bang Theory"" casting call. Matters aren't helped by the film's constant attempts to affect swagger, following the neverending-zinger formula that has made the Marvel Studio films (for example) so exhausting.

All in all, ""The Martian"" ranks as a rather average film of its type.

3.5,"I am fascinated by films that show how people survive in impossible situations. THE MARTIAN  is an old- fashioned ""feel good"" movie directed by Ridley Scott who knows how to make blockbusters and hold your attention - though here he goes ""off course"" from his usual dystopian science fiction-y horror movies like his breakthrough thriller ""Alien.""

THE MARTIAN is basically about Mark Watney, (a breeze-through performance by Matt Damon,) as an affable brilliant, but down-to-earth botanist/scientist on a manned flight mission to Mars who  is left stranded on the ""red planet"",  after a fierce storm untethers him from the rest of the crew. Dramatic footage of sand and flying debris slamming the spaceship upending its stability, forces Jessica Chastain (performing in a minor role as Melissa Lewis, the flight Commander) to make the agonizing  decision to abandon their fellow crew member - assuming he was killed by some space junk that pierced his body -  to continue their NASA mission.

The quiet after the storm shows us a steadfast Matt Damon awakening to his dire predicament, and the knowledge that death is almost a certainty, but never panics; rather he is optimistic, immediately going into survivalist mode - step by step using all that science and life experience has taught him in order to figure out how to live on a planet without water or food. One advantage is the artificial space vehicle/living habitat, or Hab which is still intact - providing oxygen and dietary supplies including his fellow astronauts' personal effects, along with a trove of ""bad"" music that becomes a continuing joke in the film. The lighthearted likeability of Matt Damon, who relates his daily chores and mundane skirmishes with the airless ""elements"" via a video diary - a technique that keeps the film buoyantly hopeful; psychological depression never sets in - so we know that Hollywood has cast a rosy net of oblivion around THE MARTIAN. And by doing so, it feeds directly into the hearts of Rocky Balboa, and sports viewing fans - we love to see America's can-do spirit triumph.

This is intrinsically a story about man's ability to endure in the face of terrible odds - which makes for great theater, and we in the audience cheer him on. Who cannot get caught up in this existential dilemma and not feel the intensity of Mark Watney's battle to exist? He is not alone - eventually there are others who join the fight to aid him in his heroic efforts to stay alive in an ""alien"" atmosphere; everyone realizing that there is a looming deadline when necessities will be depleted. Lots of actors contribute to the ensuing drama and add to the film's tension, which involves the diminished ""window of opportunity"" - to bring Astronaut Watney home while he is still alive, as the months glide by. 


The supporting actors were chosen to exemplify a ""type"" in the movie: Jeffrey Daniels as NASA's Director, caught in the vise of the political ramifications of his decisions; Michael Pena, a fellow space traveler who is the jesting buddy; Chiwetel Ejiofor, an assistant at NASA who is a catalyst for getting things done; and  a surprisingly wonderful scene-stealing performance by Donald Glover as a young ""idiosyncratic"" Jet Propulsion Lab scientist whose mathematical computations lead to innovative approaches in the rescue attempt to bring Watney home. Being a bit of a wonk, even though I don't understand the mathematics and physics involved in the computations, I am thrilled seeing numbers and formulas no longer sitting abstractly on notebook papers, but put to use to change the world we live in- another example of what a group's inventiveness and a resilient outlook can accomplish.",Grace P,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 13, 2015",Grace P,/user/id/798191139,RT,798191139,,The Martian

4.0,"The Martian is essentially Apollo 13 but on Mars.  I honestly found Apollo 13 a bit on the boring side for me.  I felt the build-up went on for too long and the scenes on Earth were not the most interesting.  Also, I was not as invested in the main characters despite being played by great actors.  This film, like Apollo 13, is on the long side with quite a bit of padding as well, but I got more invested in the characters especially Matt Damon's.  The scenes on Earth, while not great, were still enjoyable enough.
The story is very simple.  You have a NASA team on a manned mission to Mars.  On Mars a severe storm hits forcing them to leave the planet.  However, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is left behind and presumed dead.  But, in fact, he isn't dead.  Now Watney has to find a way to survive on Mars until his crew and the people of NASA can plan and conduct a rescue mission.
Besides Apollo 13 this film reminds me of the film Gravity.  You have a lone person trapped in space trying to survive space though instead of open space our main character is stranded on an alien world.  Like with Gravity what really holds this film together is its characters mainly Watney.  I will say this is probably my favorite film Matt Damon has been in.  I do not dislike Matt Damon but I never found him that great in anything either.  But this film truly brought out the best in him.
The rest of the cast does great as well.  There's not a single person that gives a bad performance.  I especially like the rest of Watney's crew.  I love the humor given out my virtually everyone in the cast.  Unlike films like Apollo 13 or Gravity there's surprisingly a lot of humor in this film and it's the right type of humor for the most part.  There's no stupid comic relief character made specifically for that purpose.  The humor comes naturally from the characters and I like that.
The film looks amazing as well.  That's always been one of Ridley Scott's strengths.  Even when the man makes a bad movie at least he delivers in the effects department.  The shots of Mars were stunning to look at as much as the scenery in Prometheus or Avatar (though that wasn't Ridley Scott). 
There were a couple things I wish they had done differently.  One thing is I think the film is too long.  Some scenes I felt were padded out and could have been shortened or just cut.  This leads me to the second thing.  
I personally did not care much for the scenes on Earth.  The stuff on Earth isn't bad but I felt like the film should have stuck mostly with Matt Damon's character just trying to survive in this hazardous world.  The thing I love with Gravity is that they never showed anything of what was happening on Earth and just stuck with Sandra Bullock's character.  All you get is a faint transmission here or there.  I think that the transmissions from NASA were all you needed to know what was happening on Earth or they could have just cut back to them periodically.  Bottom line is that the film should've focused primarily on Watney and his crew.
Overall, the Martian is the best sci-fi film of the year that's non-comic book related and one of the best films of the year.  The issues I have were really my personal preferences.  If you like films like Apollo 13 or Gravity then definitely check this out.",Mitchell B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 13, 2015",Mitchell B,/user/id/950134269,RT,950134269,,The Martian

4.0,"Review by Jesse Burleson of VIEWS ON FILM

2015's The Martian (my latest review) is different from any film Ridley Scott has ever done. Yeah it's science fiction and all but you won't see aliens swallowing up Harry Dean Stanton whole, you won't see Harrison Ford retiring any replicants, and Russell Crowe ain't cutting off people's heads while yelling, ""are you not entertained!"" (oops, wrong genre). No this is probably Scott's first foray into feel-good territory, a sort of channeling within his inner, fantasy geek (Bill Nye and characters on The Big Bang Theory would be mighty proud). With ""Martian"", you gotta think All Is Lost in outer space (ha ha, get it), Cast Away on a planet millions of miles from Earth, and fictional splendor in the form of Apollo 13 (with added humor that sometimes deflates dramatic momentum). Matt Damon in the lead role, gives us an effectual, Hanks-ian performance. He even loses weight in the flick's third act to make it look legit.

Featuring a sun-drenched, bleached look (that's Ridley for ya), title cards when various troupers are introduced (I remember seeing this in Scorsese's The Aviator), plenty of bubble gum, seventies soundtrack hits, and dialogue that doesn't seem as clunky as was featured in last year's Interstellar (Matt Damon was also a stranded space cadet in that monster, box office hit), The Martian chronicles astronaut and goofy botanist, Mark Watney (played by Cambridge's favorite son). You see Mark is left for dead, stranded on Mars. His crew thinks he got pulverized by debris in a hellish sand storm. To make matters worse, NASA informs the world that he's departed and even has a bodiless funeral for him. Watney's solution: Try to stay alive long enough for anyone listening, to realize he's not in the grave and come back to pick him up (that could take up to three years). He figures out how to grow his own food, create water from almost nothing, and locate the Pathfinder probe (a robotic spacecraft from 1997). By detecting this probe, he will get the chance to regain contact with Earth.

Now based on ""Martian's"" trailer, I thought it might be silly for NASA to garner many man-hours, fork over millions of dollars for a rescue mission, and have five of their crew members risk lives to save one dude. I was erroneous. This vehicle makes you care about it all and then some. The actors do solid work across the board. You have Oscar nominees (Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor), villainous heirs (Sean Bean), and comedic veterans (Kristin Wiig, Mackenzie Davis) contributing threefold. The film's only heavy is perhaps, space and time (you could also throw in Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, a snobbish, cocksure NASA contingent). Ah heck, it's safe to say that The Martian is darn predictable (you know Watney's gonna make it home, come on). The journey to get there though is still pretty alluring and seat-grabbing (if you wanna be Iron Man, just puncture your vacuumed suit and let it ride, hint hint).

In conclusion, various, big time directors have tried their hand at making quality cinema via the ""Red Planet"" (that includes the swooping Brian De Palma and John Carpenter). They failed miserably where Scott at least succeeds on a few levels. In the past, some of his work has lacked sentimentality relying on violent images and distant temperaments to get the job done. Here, he paints a picture more human, more amicable. Yeah The Martian is a bit overlong (a two hour running time could have sufficed things) and it sledgehammers comedy in the face of death and dying. However, when the lights go down and you have popcorn in hand, there's entertainment value plus intellectual insight to keep everyone occupied. Oh and you know what, David Bowie's ""Starman"" never sounded so good.

After a bit of a dry spell, this was a nice return to form for Ridley Scott, managing to take a film that is necessarily lower on action and direct character interaction and make it interesting, while keeping the grand visuals that have been a hallmark of his work.

4.0,"October 2, 2015

Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" is a very science-heavy film, although not in the same way Scott's ""Alien"" and ""Prometheus"" were science heavy. Those were more ""science fiction-y,"" if you know what I mean, whereas ""The Martian"" has a contemporary, real-life, human science applied to its story, the kind that feels possible, and I've no doubt several consultants lent their expertise to Drew Goddard's screenplay (and the overall production). These same consultants may even be the ones who advised Andy Weir on his original novel. 

As impressive and detailed as the technical aspects are, however, their actual accuracy isn't as important to us as the degree to which the story convinces us they're accurate. In fact, accuracy plays even less of a role if there are no worthy characters to get behind. 

Remarkably, the film manages to come across as both precise and, amidst all its scientific language and events, center around complex, three-dimensional people--people whom we genuinely care about and to whom we eventually offer our hope, thoughts and prayers. Given the rather straightforward and traditional plot, this doesn't seem like it'd be all that hard, but because so few movies these days compel us to actually stand up, cheer and cry at the end, we realize achieving such an effect is probably not so easy after all.

What the characters speak about in ""The Martian"" and the tasks they perform is literally rocket science, and as such, a lot of it flies over our heads, but that doesn't make the movie any less stimulating. Why? Because the characters make it clear exactly what has to be done. And even though the central conflict may be as basic as it gets--it really just boils down to a fundamental story of survival--it still envelops us and brings us together.  By the end, we feel like we've learned and endured as much as the characters, and the empathy the film generates is what makes it special and effective. 

The plot: sometime in the near future, a manned mission to Mars, ""Ares III,"" must suddenly abort its mission and return home because of an accelerated storm on the Red Planet. During the crew's emergency evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by flying debris, ends up lost and is presumed dead. His captain, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), reluctantly orders her team to take off without confirming officially. Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) subsequently holds a press conference announcing Watney's unfortunate accident and death. Sanders, along with NASA's head of media relations Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), begins the PR engine to save face while mission director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) wants to quickly movie forward with another expedition, salvaging the equipment from ""Ares III"" as soon as possible. In short, nobody wants to waste time harping on Watney's demise.

But one of the recurring themes throughout ""The Martian,"" and indeed what helps make it more unique, is that nothing is ever as simple as it seems and there are always more problems to solve. This includes the fact that Watney, in fact, survived his accident, which complicates not only his life, but also the lives of the NASA officials and the remaining ""Ares III"" crewmembers. Why? Because now everyone involved will be forced to make some really hard decisions that will either ensure Watney's continued survival or lead to his actual death. It sounds strange to write, but had Watney died, it would have made things so much easier.  

When Watney regains consciousness, he makes his way back to the HAB, cleans and repairs his wound (which is just one of several scenes that exhibits the film's incredible patience and attention to detail), and assesses his situation out loud. He begins a video log (which is a clever way for him to keep whoever finds it and the audience up to speed on his actions), describing what he'll have to do in order to last the four years until ""Ares IV"" arrives. 

This includes, among many other things, making water; growing his own food; staying warm; conserving fuel for his land rover; and traveling the 2,000 miles to the ""Ares IV"" landing site. Even though everything Watney has to do seems possible, none of it seems simple, but he has made a vow to himself, ""I'm not going to die here...Mars will come to fear my botany powers."" Eventually, he re-establishes contact with NASA and suddenly his dilemma is no longer his own. All the executives, scientists, engineers and other astronauts must pull together to try and rescue him.

Goddard's screenplay relentlessly introduces one hurdle after another as each of the characters struggles with their decisions, be they survival, technical, moral, ethical or business. The fact that the movie allots them time to actually weigh their options not only makes it credible, but also keeps us on our toes as we also think about the pros and cons. Goddard doesn't write the characters as archetypes, either, with one being the standard ""villain,"" or another being the ""nerd,"" etc. Each behaves as people in this conundrum probably really would, and because we can believe and identify with them on such a raw human level, the movie grows more meaningful and complicated as it goes along. It doesn't settle for easy resolutions just to accelerate the narrative, and even though the overall conclusion remains fairly obvious, it eventually erupts in a burst of well-earned emotion. 

""The Martian"" may officially be categorized as ""science fiction,"" but it's more of a drama with scientific (and not necessarily ""science fiction"") elements. It's a bold, intelligent and superbly acted film as well as a stunning technical achievement, which is no surprise given that Ridley Scott is in the director's chair. It takes us on a long, exhausting ride, to be sure, but in this case, that's a good thing.",Matthew H,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 12, 2015",Matthew H,/user/id/900752652,RT,900752652,,The Martian

The Martian is compelling and has intriguing buildup. The display of Mars is first of all amazingly beautiful - secondly, the film is smart and believable in its elaborate thinking of survival. Damon is decent but his character can a little worn out at times. He seems particularly calm at times that he's stranded - his motives seem realistic but not his behavior. Although a little long and weary especially by the dragged out ending, The Martian's only real issue in my mind was the minor characters - some NASA employees and the former crew - were particularly bland and not well constructed.

4.0,"The Martian is a hard film to review for someone that has read the book. While similar in tone and in several of the events that take place, the actual content of the two mediums are radically different. I quite enjoyed the movie for its beautiful visuals, strong acting and sharp wit, so it is easy to recommend. However, it isn't the best adaptation out there, mainly because of how much content had to be dropped for the film, which meant that most of the science behind the problems shown was not explained. This is still one of the strongest films to come out this year, and you can't help but pull for Matt Damon's character as he fights to get home. 4 out of 5 stars.",Chris B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 12, 2015",Chris B,/user/id/916496960,RT,916496960,,The Martian

4.0,"Have you seen Alien (1979)? It was a terrific thriller suspensed in an adrift space-station with single survivor. Well, herein another Ridley Scott's state-of-the-art masterpiece you won't see a real alien, even some real martian in flesh is out of question. Instead you will be served another survivor not thrilled by another martian, but his perseverance in solitude against all odds manifesting Mars which pays handsomely grand. After all, human is a sapient being bestowed with wits and spirit.

Funny thing is Matt Damon previously played as an antagonist in Interstellar (2014) -Mann, mind you-, but he plays it cool hence as the protagonist martian. Sean Bean may recall your memory with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings as Boromir. Eventually Scott pays homage to Tolkien with Project Elrond staple term.

The tracks accompanying the lone martian is enjoyable, mostly with old retro discos of 80's despite Mark's reluctant act. But some are up to date with current tunes, e.g. 30 Seconds to Mars. To match the ambient loneliness, original musics composed almost silent but nearly haunting.

Summing this flick would have to say it is enjoyable, comic, tightly-scripted, cinematographically panoramic, and devastatingly enlightening.

Survival of the fittest is the conundrum of evolution. Whether we like it or not living is not all about reproduction or hereditary matters, but what we live in the time we've been given.

5.0,"Ridley Scott and Matt Damon team up to bring us the new scifi epic The Martian; a superb story of survival that sports a great cast, script, as well as outstanding visuals. Ridley Scott is no stranger to the science fiction genre with movies like Alien, Blade Runner, and Prometheus all under his belt and here with The Martian he adds another notch. The story here revolves around Dr. Mark Wattney and his team of astronauts on a research mission on Mars. However, when a storm hits and Wattney is seperated, the crew leaves Wattney behind thinking he is dead but as fate would have it he is very much alive and stranded on the red planet. So much works in this movie so lets start with the strongest aspect of the film: the script. The writing in this movie is phenomenal with the dialogue carrying weight as well as the overall plot remembering that we as viewers are not astronauts. It is real easy to throw in an abundance space jargon in a film like this, and at times it certainly does, however the use of a character like Mark Wattney counteracts it to the point where we understand everything that is going on. Wattney's character is very humorous and sarcastic and speaks to the audience in terms that we can understand and allows us to sympathize and relate to a character that normally we wouldn't be able to. The acutal use of humor in general help set this film apart from a basic space drama and make this story feel organic and living. All the characters outside of Wattney are also very diverse in their own right and it was really refreshing to see that a movie like this can have characters that are normal rather than super-scientists. Also standing out is Ridley Scott's direction. This is a director that thrives on atmosphere and this movie is no exception. The entire film has this feel of normalcy on Earth and a barrenness on Mars that sets a perfect divide to show how different the planets are. He also has clear nods and references to tent pole scifi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey and his own Alien that shows a certain respect for the genre as a whole as well as to show a progression to what scifi can accomplish.The visual effects are also amazing with great uses of CGI as well as practical effects that give the film a more authentic feel. The cast here are all great with Matt Damon as Mark Wattney. Damon is simply perfect in this film and delivers one of his finest performances to date balancing hilarious moments as well as heart wrenching moments. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain also shine here with more great performances from Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Donald Glover, Sean Bean, and Jeff Daniels. The entire cast fires on all cyllinders here and their performances make this movie even more enjoyable than it already is. I honestly have no major complaints with this movie. The pacing isn't an issue, there are no plot holes that I noticed, and even the score and soundtrack to the film added to the effect rather than detracting from it. If I had to nitpick I would say that the definition of a SOL would have been great, but that is the smallest complaint possible. Overall The Martian is a fantastic film that really sets itself apart form other scifi movies. It could have been a stoic and depressing film with scientific lingo that would bore us but instead it is a fast paced, heart filled and often hilarious adventure that will entertain you as well as keep you at the edge of your seats. I can't recommend this one enough, go see The Martian and enjoy yourself.",Tracy S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 11, 2015",Tracy S,/user/id/816271443,RT,816271443,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/829113258/picture,The Martian
5.0,"Excellent adaptation. Matt Damon captures Watney perfectly - if you read the book you won't be disappointed by his performance.

3.5,"The Martian, from Ridley Scott, brings cultivation to Mars.

While dragging from time to time, the film's plot details manage to keep the story spellbound for a lengthy 2 hours 20 minutes.  The film moves from point to point, keeping things linear and toning the dialogue down to make things easy to follow.

The film is visually pleasing for what is mostly a deserted planet.  Not much reliance on special effects, but ultimately, things never get stale.

Matt Damon proves to be a great lead carrying this picture on his shoulders. Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor provide some solid backups.  Jessica Chastain makes the most of the time she has.

5.0,"How can I describe The Martian?  Seated in reality, thought-provoking, beautiful, intense, hilarious.  The Martian has everything, yet there's nothing like it.

The visuals, the acting, the action, this film excels in so many ways, but what carries it miles above the rest is its narrative.  Viewers are presented with a survival situation that seems hopeless, with ever-worsening odds.  As catastrophe after crippling catastrophe sets back the chances of Mark Watney, the protagonist, ever leaving the planet alive, and impending doom sets over viewers, the hero's perseverance continually comes out on top.  As Watney reminds us, hope is never lost.  We just have to take it ""one problem at a time"".

Perhaps most importantly, this is a disaster/survival film that focuses on the character, not the disaster.  Matt Damon's Mark Watney is so real, so relatable, and so believable; the performance slingshots The Martian to new heights.  His sense of humor, while hilarious, is also evidential of his humanity, his need to cope with a frightening situation.  There are times when he is surprisingly collected in lieu of tragedy and stressful situations.  These moments are followed by explosive and erratic outbursts, indicative of the true despair that he is feeling, but can't show for risk of sacrificing his chance at survival.  It is these minute character traits, so thoroughly fleshed out during the film's runtime, that make The Martian a survival film that is even greater than the sum of its parts (which are, undeniably, great in and of themselves).

The Martian has heart, and it beats at an unstoppable pace.",148word .,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 11, 2015",148word .,/user/id/965715310,RT,965715310,,The Martian

3.5,"Matt Damon alone in space fertilizing his own feces to grow potatoes while listening to disco music he despises may not sound like a winning cinema recipe, but when The Martian really gets cooking, even Rachael Ray, Wolfgang Puck and Emeril Lagasse would be jealous. If Director Ridley Scott has thrown some wild pitches of late, this 2-hour, 14-minute space flick marks his return to ace form. A jaw dropping supporting cast -- Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean and Kristen Wiig! -- play solid defense against cliches, the doldrums, the sudden explosion of existentialist space movies and anything else that could have doomed The Martian. Yet, it is Damon who brings the heat, the humor and the soul-baring subjection necessary to pitch a shutout. He has been as outstanding in other roles (The Departed comes to mind), but he has never been this magnetic. When his crew leaves him behind on Mars after a violent storm, assuming he died after being assailed by debris, Astronaut Mark Watney must use resourcefulness, science and heaping helpings of hope to survive on an uninhabitable planet. There is also the small matter of NASA thinking he perished and no facile way of communicating with Earth from Mars. You will root for Damon the way you would your favorite pitcher, hanging on every wind up, cringing each time sudden death appears imminent and cheering his successes. Whereas Interstellar and Gravity went full throttle in the despair department, Scott isn't afraid to turn parts of Watney's solo survival attempt into a stand-up comedy routine. The laughs come often but never at the expense of the drama. Even when Damon makes the audience cackle, it is impossible to ignore the stakes that accompany his every move. One false or foolhardy act. and Watney dies. As his odds of rescue diminish, the yearning for him to escape the Red Planet and return home skyrockets. As Damon's character plotted a path to endurance amidst shrinking supplies, I forgot I was in a movie theater. Instead, I was with him on Mars, clinging to the preciousness and fragility of human life, hoping he'd continue to find a way to exist and dodge the sometimes undiscriminating knife of death.

Matt Damon gets saved again... In space! In order to do that Mark Watney is going to have to science the shit out of this bitch. As the sols pass, a lot of good things came out of this viewing.

For one, I was afraid that when we were going to science the shit out of this, we were going hardcore. I hadn't read the book so I can't be sure of how balls to the walls science we were getting at. Thankfully, when talking about such complex space/time issues nothing really floated past my head. The space jargon didn't lose me on this story.

Matt Damon. Wow. I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but he evoked more emotion out of me then Leo ever could. A lot of that though has to do with the type of person Watney is. There are little bits and moments where I choked up a bit. It was an Oscar nomination that was well deserved.

The look of course would be amazing knowing we're in space. The vast emptiness of it all, something about Mark contrasting the grand scale of Mars it left me in awe. Planet Earth will occasionally pull me out of it which sucked at times, but I wasn't left bored of those scenes either. I genuinely wanted to know about how we were sending supplies, or of all the immense decisions the people in NASA had to make in saving Private Ryan err Mark. All dramatic story beats were clicking.

It's a bit unfortunate and possibly classically hollywood cash-cowing, that this one comes while Gravity is still in relatively recent memory. This ode to problem solving directed by Ridley Scott is good, with all the quality you might expect for a director of Alien.  It seems odd that I should see 2 movies in one weeked in 3D from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. The dude knows his stuff. With the combo of actual landscapes CG'ed as one might expect, the resulting visual are convincing. The storyline is linear. The tension for the big moment is intense. And Damon clearly had to suffer through some major dieting. The result feels a bit more summer blockbuster than Oscar worthy, and that is fine for most of us audience folk.

4.5,"From coming in with next door to zero interest in what looked to be this years Interstellar - a term to me that means a big flashy sci-fi film that people loved that I didn't - The Martian is... Suprisingly one of the best films i've seen this year and the best Ridley Scott movies in nearly 10 years! Good job Ridders ;)

The Martian is a smart, concise and most importantly entertaining film that keeps you engaged in the story, environment and characters from the very first shot of Mark Watney (aka Maaaaaaaatt Daaaaaaaamon) on Mars. Speaking of Matt Damon; this is one of his most affable, sensitive and genuine roles I have ever seen him take on and is a joy whenever he appears on screen. Despite his impossible, albeit fantastical, odds his spirit and good humour really drive the film and cause great empathy for the story as a whole. The rest of the cast is a mind-blowing list of whose who in Hollywood - Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Donald Glover, Michael Pena and even Sean Bean! - who provide moments of levity, depth and sometimes both in the case of my favourite supporting player in the film; Benedict Wong. The compiled score of disco and glam rock is put to good use and combines well with the somewhat unavoidable play by the numbers composed hollywood score. What also, in my opinion, makes The Martian better than Interstellar is that The Martian is ACTUALLY smart! No exposition felt forced as the context it was used within fit and served the scene well as well as the science used and explained was easy to follow and once again made fun to watch. The Martian for me is one of the best films i've seen all year and will hopefully remain in my top 10, maybe even top 5!, soooo... yeah...

5.0,"This was one of my favourite books of last year, if not my favourite. Whenever anyone came near me asking for a good sci-fi read, or a good read in general ""The Martian"" was up there. A space story that isn't sci-fi and not full of so much techno babble that you lose the story as you try and figure out the rest. It's basic. Man is left for dead Mars. Man must survive on Mars. Will man get off Mars? Will man make contact with Earth? The film does leave that part as much of a mystery thanks to the trailer but it still works. 

It's a nice change to have a space story that's not about the end of a world. Very basic story that is carried just on the characters, which is really the human race in general narrowed down to a few key players as they relate to what they contribute to the plans.

It also manages to make an exclusively disco soundtrack work. Seriously. Why disco? You'll find out.

Casting is perfect. Matt Damon was someone I could see as Mark even before they actually cast him and I love who they chose for everyone else too. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, and  Chiwetel Ejiofor in particular. 

It's great time, it looks gorgeous, feels very very plausible (both in situations and Mark's solutions and reactions, which always was a winner for me in how everyman they were in the book).

In this adaptation of the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, Matt Damon stars as astronaut Mark Watney, stranded on Mars after his Aries III team led by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is forced to abandon their mission & the planet during the onslaught of a massive storm. Realizing that his team believes he died during the storm & with only thirty days worth of supplies left, Watney uses his skills as a botanist to find a way to grow food in the effort to survive the next four years until the next mission, Aries IV arrives. Back at NASA, mission director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) & satellite planner Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) discover photographic evidence that Watney is still alive & begin brainstorming with NASA crew supervisor Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean,) JPL director Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong) & NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) on a plan to send a probe full of supplies to Mars. Directed by Ridley Scott  from a screenplay written by Drew Goddard, The Martian is a masterfully entertaining film with intense action & pitch-perfect humor throughout the film. The performances form this all-star cast were top-notch. The cast also features Kate Mara as astronaut Beth Johanssen, Michael PeÃ±a as astronaut Rick Martinez, Sebastian Stan as astronaut Chris Beck, Donald Glover as NASA astronomer Rich Purnell, & Kristen Wiig as NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose.

3.0,"Overlong, but likeable sci-fi yarn, that is strong on the science, and lighter than many on the special effects.  This film depends on the acting of Matt Damon as Mark Watney.  He is a sympathetic character set against a variety of folk at NASA back on earth, who provide some narrative tension.  The problem with the plot of this film is that growing food is not a very cinematic activity and *spoiler alert"" when counting potatoes is a matter of life and death, it is hard to make it look dramatic.

4.0,"The Martian is a uniquely different science-fiction movie that features one of the best protagonists I have seen this year. The movie is consistently engaging, features witty dialogue, tremendous cinematography and stellar performances from its actors, even though; at times the movie feels somewhat repetitive and a bit too long. 

The movie revolves around an astronaut and botanist, Mark Whatney (Matt Damon), who gets left behind on Mars during a manned mission and is presumed dead by his crew and his people working at NASA. However, Whatney, somehow, survives and attempts to get out of Mars by using his training and knowledge of science. 

In terms of plot and themes, this movie really could have ended up being a cliché. It has a protagonist who is pitted against all odds to survive (remember '127 Hours', 'Gravity') and has him stuck in somewhere outside the Earth (obvious comparisons to 'Interstellar' and again 'Gravity'). What then is truly remarkable is that after watching this movie, I did not say that is was 'a funny version of 'Interstellar'' or that it was a 'Gravity 2.0'. The best thing this movie does is create its own identity and convinces me to recognize it as 'The Martian'.  And the biggest reason why I will remember it as 'The Martian' is because director 'Ridley Scott' takes a completely different approach in handling this survival story and manages to create a protagonist so loveable that the movie deserves to be seen just for the character alone. And that is the biggest asset of 'The Martian' - Mark Whatney. The character is written, directed and acted out brilliantly. 'Matt Damon' does such a terrific job with this character by making him loveable, outrageously funny and memorable, that you really want to 'Martian' just for him again. I truly think he gives one of the best performances of the year - not only because he is funny but also because he pulls off every scene terrifically and I could not see anyone else doing this role better than him. 

The movie also works prominently because of the tone 'Ridley Scott' chooses to tell this story. 'Scott' chooses to pepper this movie with so much humor (through Damon's character as well as the supporting cast) that this movie keeps you engaged almost throughout. In all honesty, I was really surprised by how 'Scott' handled this survival story so differently and that is what gave the movie its unique likeability and repeat value. The technical aspects of the film just complement the tone really well. The cinematography is, expectedly, terrific by 'Darius Wolski' and Mars, in particular, seems to have been captured beautifully. The movie, overall in terms of its visuals, looks stunning, and that just adds to the movies qualities. 

I did, however, have some issues with the movie. The movie, even though, engaging enough for the most part, tends to drag a little and starts to get a bit repetitive just before it's ending. When I came out of the theatre, I kind of felt I saw a 3 hour-long movie when the movie was about 2 hr and 20 min long and there were some scenes in the movies act preceding the finale, when I started getting restless and wanted the movie to pick up some pace. Also, I felt that some of the characters relationships were underwritten. I was particularly disappointed by how less we see of the crew in this movie! The crew had some very interesting characters (Michael Peña was my personal favorite) but I felt they were majorly underused. 'Jessica Chastain', in particular, was surprisingly underused and her relationship with 'Damon's' character just never developed for me. The actors play their parts really well (everyone at NASA, especially, 'Kristen Wiig', 'Jeff Daniels' and 'Chiwetel Ejiofor' are memorable) and each of them add to the main plot considerably but some of these relationships just never create an emotional impact on you because they seem half-baked. The humor, for the most part, makes up for the lack of emotional connect, but I just wished they had explored some of these relationships more.

Overall, however, I do see The Martian as a movie, which would be truly hard to dislike because it features a wonderful protagonist played terrifically by 'Matt Damon', some terrific action set pieces (especially the climax), and wonderfully funny moments that keep this movie almost always engaging.

4.5,"I'm neither a huge Ridley Scott (I do love Alien and Prometheus though) nor a Matt Damon Fan. So you may imagine my expectations when I went to see this movie and how surprised I felt when the credits rolled. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. For a desolated story, The Martian is incredibly inspiring. Much of it charm depends entirely on Matt Damon's performance, his effort keeps the movie light and humorous even through the tougher times. It probably wouldn't have worked with another actor. He brings a strangely infectious joy instead of constant wallowing. The positive and identifiable attitude of his character will translate well to audience. After this, there's quite a slight chance that I end up as a Matt Damon Fan (if he continues just like that). He's the first actor who managed to turn my liking around. I guess that means something at least. The humor and Damon's normal-guy qualities -- despite being a genius scientist -- make living on Mars all the more relatable to us. He's such a gem in this science fiction adventure, all the way!
I cried, I laughed, I felt excited - and that's what cinema is supposed to do. To make people feel. Well, seems like Ridley Scott really nailed it for me this time. He created a movie that is touching, magnificent, surprising, and surprisingly funny and light hearted. Never a dull moment. The Martian has a great blend of tension and humor, and if you're a science geek, this movie will be a treat. Ridley Scott did a really great job directing this movie as well as Drew Goddard for writing the screenplay. The writing is the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it is clever, funny, never lost my attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone. 

Visually it is amazing. This is not the beast Gravity was, but when it gets going, it's utterly beautiful and also bizarrely captivating since Mars is a barren soil. At times it appears that Matt Damon walks across red desert which is so strange but still give the feeling that it probably exist somewhere. The amount of details on science is amazing, it feels like an inviting project or a trip audience could take with these characters. The bits of pop culture reference from comics or movies are icing of the frosty cake.
I was highly impressed at the end.

5.0,"Lo and behold one of the best movies Iâ??ve seen in 2015 so far: the wildly compelling, highly entertaining, and surprisingly funny â??The Martianâ??; directed by Ridley Scott (whose directorial redemption has just been approved after some flops) and based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir. Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, an astronaut who gets stranded in Mars after things go wrong with his mission and his crew mistakenly believes he had died in the incident. Yep, a complete clusterfuck, because now, how is he going to survive in a barren wasteland that resembles Mad Maxâ??s Citadel? Wellâ?¦

Matt Damon kills it as Mark, he brings forth an incredibly large dosage of charisma and talent, which makes the delivery of most punchlines a success, and it kind of makes you believe that no other actor would have worked for this role. He completely owns the screen. Scenes that could have been extremely boring were the exact opposite thanks to his performance. Furthermore, he establishes a deep and powerful relationship with the audience from Sol 1 and this makes everyone care about his well-being. I now kind of want to get ditched in Mars with him, it would be hysterical. I cannot possibly explain in words how badly I wanted him to survive, to the extent that I was quite nervous about the outcome of the film for a good straight hour, completely forgetting that I was watching something entirely fictionalized (itâ??s not even a true story like Apollo 13), so you can see the power of storytelling right there, or more accurately, the power of this adaptation and its faithfulness to its source (granted, I still need to read the book).

Next to him (but a zillion miles away), thereâ??s a magnificent supporting cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathawâ?¦wait no, Kate Mara (I miss Zoe Barnes), Sebastian Stan, Michael PeÃ±a, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean (phew, so many good actors). Special props to Benedict Wong and Donald Glover for being great at their roles (that Lord of the Rings reference almost killed meâ?¦in a good way I mean).

Furthermore, the visuals are amazing: the cinematography, the visual effects, and the production design are top-tier. It all works perfectly to completely envelop the spectator into the world of the story, not to mention the beautiful score by Harry Gregson-Williams as well. Everything and more makes this film one of the most enjoyable and enthralling films of the year; I havenâ??t cared so much for a charactersâ?? survival probably since Argo in 2012. The Martian is now probably one of my favorite space movies ever. So, thank you Ridley Scott, for successfully transforming this beautiful work by Andy Weir into a visual and cinematic delight, which brought about a humongous smile on my face. Yes, this is a feel-good movie.

By the way, how is it possible that Sean Beanâ??s character did not die? Is something wrong going on in the world? Have I been kept in the dark about something?

5.0,"This is probably one of the best Mars space movie since Total Recall in 1990. That being said, The Martian is a tour de force science fiction film, and it never let go of its realism to the Hollywood and Space mission program. It's Ridley Scott after all who directed this movie, and I think it's now officially one of his bests along with Alien, Blade Runner, and among others. The cast leading with Damon himself, and the rest of the all star cast, gave all their best performances, and of course it's Damon's show that we should look upon on. Much like Gravity and Interstellar, it shows how outer space can have a different world and even a new life to begin with, what I think that is different on this flick is how completely the movie somehow manages to have some humor surprisingly and I think that idea is probably to take away the fear and claustrophobic tension that the movie delivers and to the Damon's character as well. As I mentioned earlier about the amazing supporting cast here, they would just do everything to bring him home and so does the whole globe that depends on this mission. I personally gonna say this as one of the bests of 2015, but honestly even though I'm giving this a higher rating, I still believe there will be more other movies that are gonna come which are better than this, in fact I'm not even saying, Gravity and/or Interstellar are much better than this. Scott is a genius in moviemaking he doesn't disappoint, this movie is beautiful looking. In pretty sure he will get an Oscar nomination for directing this film.

4.0,"MOVIE REVIEW:

          The Martian is out of this world.

         It is sweeping and inspiring and heartbreaking.  It is a movie that imagines the best of us doing the best for us.  In the process - it shows nobody is immune to loneliness and desperation.  Indeed, I recall my first weekend at college so many years ago - and how lonely I felt just 50 miles from home while surrounded by thousands of people.  The mere thought of being stranded 50 million miles from home - with no conceivable way to contact anyone - is overwhelming.

	A manned mission to Mars is caught off guard by a fast moving storm - and as it approaches - astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is felled by debris whipping by at hundreds of miles per hour.  With Watney knocked out and lost in hurricane like conditions, his fellow crew members spend precious time looking for him - all the while putting themselves in greater and greater danger.  Finally, with no time remaining -- the heartbreaking decision to end the search is reluctantly made - and the survivors rush to escape the life threatening storm and begin the 10 month journey home without their friend.

	When Watney comes to - we see he is badly injured having been impaled by space debris that initially knocked him out.  He is hurt, he is stranded, and he has no ready way to communicate with anyone -- anywhere.

	Matt Damon was perfectly cast as astronaut Watney.  He is believable.  And what happens the rest of the way will call on every ounce of intelligence and physicality and perseverance to survive the impossible.

	The Martian is outstanding movie making.  It is thrilling and funny and smart.  It is endearing and humane.  It is hopeless and hopeful.
	
          Bennett and I loved this movie.  We give it an 8+ on our 10 point scale.",Charlie M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 10, 2015",Charlie M,/user/id/906754270,RT,906754270,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001895927411/picture,The Martian
5.0,"I cannot exaggerate how good this movie is. Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney felt so real. His behaviour as he deals with the solitude is exactly what you imagine yourself doing, intense frustration as things go awry coupled with humour. The emotional reaction of Watney as he receives his first human contact in months was very touching. Ridley Scott and his crew also bring a great level of attention to detail that brings this film out of the realm of science fiction and into realism. Both the science displayed in the film and the behind-the-scenes politics happening on Earth make this feel like it could have actually took place.
The film is both dramatic and humorous. Watney joking with himself in his video logs and other moments throughout the film keep it from coming off as over dramatic. In addition to the science packed plot, references to Infocom games, Lord of the Rings, Iron Man, and barrel rolls make this film a geek's dream. If interest in space exploration was ever in decline, this film will definitely reignite that interest. The Martian officially joins my list of all-time favourites.",Matt M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 10, 2015",Matt M,/user/id/971838708,RT,971838708,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153153503591406/picture,The Martian

4.5,"I saw the sci-fi film The Martian today, and it was awesome & entertaining film.

Visually, the movie looked wonderful, and I enjoyed the acting as well as the humor in the film.

Even though I had problems understanding some of the science talk, I still enjoyed & loved this film.

And, contrary to what Matt Damon's character Mark Watney said, disco definitely doesn't sucks!

I recommend everyone to see this film in theatres.

4.0,"I've heard a lot of great things about this movie, and I must say the praise is well earned. 
Matt Damon gives a great performance, he's very charismatic and his character is very likable. The rest of the cast, while having limited screen time, are great. Chiwetel Ejiofor shines in a supporting role among others. The story is simplistic but engaging, the movie is quite long but rarely lost my interest. The writing was actually very funny at times, Watney is an optimist and that makes for a more light hearted experience than one might expect. It really makes you want to watch and root for him. The final rescue sequence is edge of your seat entertainment, it's outcome is predictable but gripping none the less. 
In regards to any negatives, I have a few. Watney is a likable everyman that you care about, but the large cast of characters besides him fade into the background. His fellow astronauts on two occasions are give rushed character development that feels very forced. The pacing/structure of the movie weren't perfect, there are stretches of long scenes back on Earth in the second third that leave us wanting to go back to the Mars situation with our protagonist. And it definitely could have trimmed 15 minutes off its runtime and would have been a better paced adventure.

4.5,"The Martian is a fantastic depiction of the potential of man kind and what we are capable of when we work together and push effort to the fullest. 

All of the pieces of this film came together with excellence. The script was very well crafted and presented to us in a timely fashion without distancing us from any particular story development or character. The script worked well with its source material focusing on moments of extreme importance and cutting moments that may be redundant or underplayed due to the nature of the film medium. The tone of the picture is heavy with scientific discussion but counter weighted appropriately with a sense of humor. 

Performances are top notch all across the board. Matt Damon plays Mark Watney with great personality that fits perfectly with the characters charm from the novel. 

Visually the film is stunning as is standard with the director Ridley Scott. What is wonderful about this picture ultimately is that Scott was given the right script, which I cannot stress enough. He was manage all of his skills and pieces to make this film as great as it could be because it started in the right direction.

4.5,"The Martian is a must see movie in 3D I personally recommend watching it in that format or you wont be able to enjoy it as much as I did. If you aren't the 3D type person I would still recommend watching it. I am not a Ridley Scott fanatic, but I am glad to say that he finally picked himself back up from the blow of the last two movies like Exodus: Gods and Kings and Prometheus. He made amends with his audience with this movie. I can say that by far its one of his best films today. I like Robin Hood and Gladiator also the Kingdom of Heaven all three great films but him tackling down The Martian was a huge hitter for me because after hearing and seeing how bad Prometheus was I began to doubt if Ridley Scott would follow all the scenes from the book, and bring a different story then what the book had foretold. After all Hollywood is known for ruining the books from their movie adaptations. I went into the movie expecting a lot and I received as much as I expected and loved the improvisations Matt Damon added to the character of Mark Watney. Although for the sake of movie time and unnecessary scenes for the film, they did took out some scenes from the book that are easily forgiveable in my opinion I thought if they didn't take them out it would have added an extra challenge to the character of Mark Watney and would have left the audience to the edge of their seat. Though as much as I wanted it to be in the film it was not shown. Movies cant be as long as books so therefore some scenes have to be taken out. The humor in the film is by far the best i've seen in a sci-fi film, The humor does not reference any inappropriate sayings other than cuss words,like say the F-bomb. It is a PG-13 movies so parents if you want to take your kids be aware that there is cuss words. As for that the whole film is adventure packed and science packed as well.

And the background and the hope this film presents is grounded on is our quest to reach beyond the limits of Earth's gravity (and so it loudly parades that we'll overcome every adversity). Now there's science here but let's not get too excited. The emphasis is interestingly on the personalities involved, interestingly because while the characters are the primary focus of this tale on one hand, on the other hand they are only the flimsiest of constructs with zero time spent ""getting to know them"". We only watch while they react to danger. Who they are or who they might be outside of these situations, we never get to see. This momentary drawback weakens the film, but only by a bit.

After three consecutive missteps (the abysmal ""Prometheus"" and ""The Counselor,"" and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" which I haven't braved yet), director Ridley Scott is on much surer footing, giving Andy Weir's book an authentic, realistic look and getting the most out of his A-list cast... but they easily could've edited a good chunk out of the 141 minute running time, especially in the third act when things take far too long to get to the inevitable conclusion.

Yes. I've seen all the jokes about America spending too much money to get back Matt Damon, especially in Saving Private Ryan, Interstellar and now The Martian. But if getting back Matt Damon gives us such wonderful films, let him get stranded more I say!
The Martian, a Ridley Scott adaptation of an Andy Weir novel (which I haven't read yet), is one of the year's best films. And oh, it is one of the best survival in space films (yes, I found this better than Gravity). Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and his crew - which comprises of two MCU legends, The Winter Soldier [Stan Sebastian] and Luis from Ant-Man [Michael Pena], Susan Storm from the rebooted Not-so-Fantastic Four [Kate Mara], Murph from Interstellar [Jessica Chastain], and some random German guy [Aksel Hennie] - are on a manned mission to Mars, in the probe Ares III. When Mars is hit by an intense storm, the crew is forced to abandon the planet. But there's one little problem - Mark Watney has been hit by the debris from the storm and is left back by the crew. They presume he's dead. Only that he's not, and thus begins the long saga of his survival and subsequent return (does he?) to Planet Earth - but I'll leave that for you guys to see.
Ridley Scott, the man who gave us the brilliant Alien, is finally back on form after a string of disappointing films that included Prometheus, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings. Please let's have more of the same. The Martian is thought-provoking, funny, and an awe-inspiring adventure. And it owes most of this largely to its brilliant leading man, Non-Resident Earthling Matt Damon, and the supporting cast, which included Jeff Daniels the Director of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Dr. Vincent Kapoor (don't ask me how) and surprise, surprise, an alive-and-well Sean Bean (who STAYS alive-and-well) as Mitch Henderson, the director of the mission (I almost thought he would make some grim proclamation like 'WINTER IS COMING ON MARS').
Most of the second half comprises of NASA trying to get Mark Watney back, but Scott's deft direction and an effective screenplay by Drew Goddard ensure that you don't nod off. There is another major reference to another Marvel character (seriously, this could've been a movie in the MCU), but I'll leave that for you to find out. Hell, with so many comic book references they could've even named this the Martian Manhunt (which isn't Marvel, but you get the drift).
All-in-all, The Martian is a movie you MUST watch. Try to get a show timing for 2D (English), if not, then IMAX 3D. Don't go for regular 3D. And yes, in the words of Gloria Gaynor, YOU WILL SURVIVE it.

4.5,"I found this movie had an interesting plot with its sci-fi genre. It was interesting to see life in a different planet portrayed in a different person's (director's) perspective. Even though I liked the movie and found it engaging because of it's unique storyline in 21st century cinematography, I found the general plot and the theme of the movie was somewhat redundant with a simple, straightforward storyline. The storyline entailed the protagonist going through multiple scenarios where he was placed in a situation with no hope, however these situations were easily resolved in the movie. In short, I was obviously expecting a man conquering a tough situation, however the number of difficult situations he faced and how quickly he adapted to his changing situations/environment made the movie seem moreso improbable. The protagonist, being a NASA scientist, seemed to be too intellectual and adapted without any pessimism or hesitation in acts when struck by terrible situations one after another. Psychologically, one would expect a person stranded in a deserted planet for numerous months to be going a little insane, but the protagonist seemed to maintain an optimistic, jovial attitude which seemed surprising to me, showing the true strength of humanity. Thus, lack of pessimistic thoughts from the protagonist made the film redundant towards the end, since the audience could tell this film had a happy ending and nothing could stop the protagonist from overcoming any situation. All in all, I did love the film, but I would realistically not watch it again since the plot is something that is not unexpected.",Elias C,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 09, 2015",Elias C,/user/id/804508725,RT,804508725,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/628746477/picture,The Martian

4.0,"The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded on Mars after a storm hits and he is presumed dead by his crew.
brilliant acting from Matt Damon. this is his best performance since The Departed. You really buy him as a man stranded but still has hope that he will survive. every emotion on his face and every line of great comedy that he gives is perfection. every other actor does a really good job. but nothing in this movie compares to Matt Damon. 
The cinematography and directing is very good as well with Ridley Scott returning to form after a string of mediocre movies and one of the worst movies iver ever seen in The Counselor. the long takes of just the dry desert like land that is Mars are mesmerizing and gorgeous. when the camera is placed on Matt Damon shoulder for logs i think it works very well.
The script is also very good. what could have been a depressing movie ending up being a great drama with a lot of comedy (which for the most part works). the script really knows the character of Mark Watney. however it doesn't seem to know many of the others that aren't main characters. Chiwetel Ejiofor is pretty well thought out, and so is Jeff Daniels but otherwise, the characters are interesting and likable but seem a little hollow besides a few small glimpses here and there. the only character on mark's crew that I felt he had a deep connection with was Michael PeÃ±a. and that's really my biggest flaw with the movie.

Ridley Scott's latest is another addition to the list of science fiction films set in space in the last few years. But unlike last year's ""Interstellar"", this one packs an emotional punch. It is more of a human drama than a special effects extravaganza. And as a space opera, it is smart and rich in ideas that engrosses without getting overwhelmed in all the science.

4.0,"The basic premise of this film is a stranded astronaut  (Matt Damon as Mark Watney) stranded alone on the planet Mars after a manned mission to the planet goes wrong with Watney apparently left for dead (some 225 million kilometres away from earth on average).
I was drawn to this film by the advertising campaign that coincided with news stories about the presence of water on the Red Planet.
I have always had a fascination with space science fiction and science fact films be it Apollo 13 to Moonraker, Star Trek to Star Wars.
I had a few issues with this film:
1) The obsession with time. Time be it in the constant reminder of the sheer distance between Earth and Mars. 
The time it takes to physically travel to Mars by spacecraft, probes and even radio communication.
2) The supporting cast was good be it Jeff Bridges as the fat controller of NASA.
Sean Bean has a prominent role. (I thought he was cinematically dead only appearing in the odd Channel 4 drama in the UK as a cross dresser!)
Bean has visibly aged.  His attempt at foreign accents trying to hide his Sheffield, Yorkshire tongue is amusing.
Chiwetel Ejofor who had a moving part in the excellent 12 Years A Slave plays some Mars geek at NASA.
3) Sol. No not the drink. A Martian day in this film. Don't ask!
4) A diet that consists solely of self grown potato. I couldn't think of anything worse. Surely it would cause some sort of vitamin deficiency. This element is not explored by director Ridley Scott.
5) The Chinese space agency coming to the rescue of NASA. Who needs those pesky Russians? The film studio trying to capitalise on the lucrative Chinese market perhaps?

The film has a good dose of humour mainly in the form of some of its 1970s soundtrack ala The Full Monty and Mamma Mia.

5.0,"""The Martian"" is simultaneously a great movie and an elegant description of engineering. At its simplest, engineering is solving a problem within given boundaries. In the real world, there are so many more variables. There is no black box problem in reality. In our existence, we must factor in time, money, mortality, weather, skills, nerves, and probability. This movie is exceptional at giving us the difficult equations and demonstrating what must be done to solve them. 

The movie has heart, laughs, tension, and, most importantly, brains. Brains are all too often missing from movies and take a backseat to emotion. Now they are co-pilots.
There are many recognizable faces and they all contribute in a big way.  It's not a coincidence that you can call them out from all their geeky projects that preceded this. Hey, that's Will Hunting in space! His commander is Murph from Intertellar! There's Boromir, that badass assassin from Serenity, Sue Storm, and the Winter Soldier!

Matt Damon plays an astronaut marooned on Mars - who has to fight to survive while his crew, and NASA, scratch headsâ?? over rescue plans.  Based on the novel, director Ridley Scott has delivered an epic sci-fi drama that will keep you glued to you seat.

To quote, he has to â??science the sh*t out of this planet!â??.

As interesting as that first film may have been, what made it to the screen is thrilling, hilarious, and only slightly infuriating.  Weir's story comes to life in a much fuller sense on screen rather than with his in-need-of-a-copy-editor prose, albeit at the slight expense of some serious nerding out.

4.5,"Sometimes, films don't have to push boundaries or revolutionise cinema in order to be really good. They can, in fact, just be neat and polished; do everything they're supposed to correctly and do it well. The Martian is the latter. 

More science fact than science fiction, The Martian brings a very human drama to alien surroundings with great success. The very neat and tidy screenplay shows it's novel origins throughout and it never once drags. It's paced brilliantly through the highs and lows of the drama and is genuinely gripping from start to finish.

The fabulous ensemble cast do fine work too. Matt Damon hasn't been this good in a while and he's got fine support from everyone involved. Some of the characterisations are a little cliché but, as I say, it's all done rather well. So you don't care.

The gravitas of the situation is superbly undercut by the disco soundtrack, which brings a welcome degree of levity to proceedings. However, it also makes you acutely aware of the paint-by-numbers nature of such a man-against-adversity story. We know Mark Watney is going to survive. No matter how much we're teased with otherwise outcomes, the story is always winding toward the inevitable. It's a paint-by-numbers thorn that won't leave The Martian's side.

It's a minor gripe, but one that robs it of a 5 star rating.

It was recently pointed out to me, to my agreement, that Ridley Scott's reputation is based on only three truly great films. He does a fine job here and his efforts can certainly be considered more Alien/Gladiator than A Good Year/Robin Hood.

3.5,"The Martian is the latest film from Ridley Scott, written by the talented Drew Goddard based on a best-selling novel by Andy Weir. It is a survival story about an astronaut left alone on Mars, who uses his scientific knowledge to survive. It is a simple and straight-forward concept with the potential to become an entertaining popcorn movie. There has been a lot of movies about Mars, movies about lone castaways, and sometimes the combination of the two (1964's Robinson Crusoe on Mars). Also, in recent years, we have seen movies that showed us the most realistic depiction of space travel that cinema can offer (Interstellar and Gravity). But this time, Ridley Scott helms the new space adventure, which is a genre he has done brilliantly before with Alien (1978). It has been a long time since he made a great movie, but after watching The Martian, we can safely say that not only this is one of his best films in years, but also one of the best in this genre.

The crew of NASA's Ares III mission is collecting samples on the Red Planet when a violent sandstorm whips up. In all of the zero-visibility chaos, the commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), tries to walk her crew through the otherworldly swirl of rock and sand. But when one astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is injured and shows no vital signs, they leave him behind, presumed dead. Watney, of course, is alive, although when he come to, battered and bleeding, there's already an automated voice warning him ""oxygen level critical"". The team leave only enough provisions to last a few months. Which sounds like a long time until we're told by NASA officials (Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor) that it will take four years before a rescue party can reach him. Watney may be alive, but he's living with a death sentence unless he can figure out a way to use his wits and turn the lifeless planet into a makeshift Eden with water and food. Fortunately, he's a botanist.

The film doesn't waste any time and starts off strong with a great sequence involving the astronauts in Mars doing their job when suddenly a big storm forces them to leave the area. Afterwards, we find out how Watney survived and begin spending more time with him alone in the space station while he figures out how to survive. The visual landscapes of Mars look spectacular and the cinematography makes the best out of the setting. The film manages to make us feel what it is like to be stranded there, thanks to Scott's brilliant visual aesthetic and Matt Damon's charismatic performance. The biggest surprise however, is how funny the script is. This could have easily been made into a dark and violent survival drama but instead, Goddard's script finds the humor in Watney's situation and puts it in his mannerism and dialogue. This makes the character more likable and inspiring as someone who never gives up and goes above and beyond to survive. The movie is not just focused on Watney's situation however; we also spend time on Earth where the NASA executives are working hard to figure out a way to reach their man. All the relationships matter and most of the science talk is simple enough to keep our attention while the humor will give them more personality. The final act - while being predictable - is a fantastic sequence full of ""edge of your seat moments"" with visual imagery as beautiful as the best scenes in Gravity.  

As said above, Damon is great in the lead role and manages to deliver one of his best performances in years. As he begins recording his video logs, we feel as if he is talking directly to us, documenting everything and delivering funny one liners whenever he can. The rest of the case deliver a solid performance as well. Jeff Daniels as the NASA director comes closest to a villain as the film can offer while Chiwetel Ejiofor is the mission's director who never lets go of finding ways to bring their member back to Earth. Also key in the narrative involves Watney's crew led by Jessica Chastain's Commander Lewis. The crew actors don't have enough screen time to make a big impact but their time on the screen is always strong and necessary. There is a running gag about Watney's disdain for Commander Lewis' taste in music. In fact, music plays a significant part in the story with the unexpected tunes adding up to the overall enjoyment.


The film isn't perfect however, and one of the main flaws is the relatively long running time (2 hours and 21 minutes) that could have easily been trimmed for a faster and punchier ride. Also, some of the secondary characters - including Kristen Wiig's - are underdeveloped and do nothing but standing around reacting to what every one else says. And finally, the ending is oddly cheesy considering how uncorny everything else leading up to it is. But this flaws will not take away much from the thrilling enjoyment of the finished film. Damon carries the film with good support from the strong cast, great score, amazing visuals and Scott's solid direction. This is a funny, exciting and well-crafted picture that needs to be seen on the biggest screen available.",Nima S,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 09, 2015",Nima S,/user/id/906790057,RT,906790057,,The Martian

4.0,"Unusually feel-good for a sci-fi film, especially a Ridley Scott one, but The Martian works because it knows just what it wants to be and stays there. Matt Damon anchors the film with his character's optimism and smarts, and there's a solid bunch of supporting players as well. The cinematography gives Mars a really nice look that separates it from feeling like it was filmed on earth. Visual effects are used in a healthy restraint that makes the riveting climax all the more special. Although much of it is upbeat, there enough tense moments that keep the film from feeling monotonous. Tonally, the film hits all the beats that it strives for with ease. Character development isn't much of a concern, and one can't help but feel that adding some would make the character's struggle more compelling.

But what makes this film adaption so fantastic, is that with everything that this film achieves, it achieves it without having to rely on the humor to tell the story.

However, Damon is charismatic enough to carry the film on his shoulders and inject a decent amount of humor into things.

Visually, Mars looks and feels a desolate and barren as one can imagine. The film boasts some truly stunning landscape shots of the Red Planet. Even the space shots are pretty.

The story is solid and simple: Figure out how to get off the planet. There's no real holes or major issues with the story. If the film has a problem at all, it's that some members of its all-star cats are wasted. Kristin Wiig gets hits hardest by this. She has maybe... five lines in the whole movie and gets third billing? Aside from Damon, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Donald Glover are the best supporting players here. 

Overall, it's a solid movie. It's nothing revolutionary, but it is a solid story told well.",Indi V,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 08, 2015",Indi V,/user/id/791606864,RT,791606864,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/667158338/picture,The Martian

4.0,"Wow! What an experience this film was. Ridley Scott has crafted a truly masterful piece of filmmaking, which sounds completely clichÃ (C), but there's no other way to put it. This is a work of art, and a masterpiece in suspense and vision.

Not once during this film do not feel exactly as Scott wants you to. I try to measure a filmmaker's success based on the consistency in pace, as well as the communication of emotion of the film in question. This is a great movie that creates and maintains a sense of tension and adventure on Mars, and effectively creates an equally tense and nerve-racking tone on Earth as the clock quickly winds down.

0.5,"Typical Ridley Scott and great filmmaker FORMULA.  Great Film  = high concept +characters.  But the actors couldn't get it right for the life of em.  Why Prometheus was better as a movie is because using relative unknowns unlike Matt Damon.  Stupidest thing I heard after a movie ever was some girl say ""Matt Damon is awesome!""  1 there is NO  MOVIE with NO SCRIPT, that'd make the scriptwriter of more importance than Damon.  There is no vision or direction without a director, which Damon is not.  And since he is a bigger than life person thanks to Hollywood there really is NO QUESTION he will live and not die in the movie.  Hence that's why he's wrongly cast in a role where someone who is not Superman is supposed to survive.  According to Hollywood all superstars are the reason for life itself and better than any other person, just so amazing. lol.

AND to top it off this movie WILL NOT INSPIRE PEOPLE TO GO TO SPACE.   Because of the danger and risk portrayed this won't help NASA or any space program, which at the end of the movie it shows it's attempting to do just that.  In general people only say they are ""willing to die"" for something but for some strange reason can't give even just 1 hour a day for MANY YEARS to that thing they say they love whatever art, science, or whatever.  Then you portray this NON martyr as someone who sacrificed ""everything"" for his craft?  There are FAR better REAL stories in REAL life from Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr to Thomas Edison to a million other people who actually lived that hardcore attitude in their chosen art and ARE NOT some FAKE Hollywood actor pretending to be that  In reality most actors just get lucky because they have a little skill and are part of the majority crowd or a minority that the majority wants to help out.

And BORING.  If you don't believe this movie is sub par,  watch it TWICE.  Oh wait you won't because it's that bad and YOU WON'T.

3.5,"The Martian is about a crew of NASA astronauts in the year 2050 conducting a mission on Mars. The movie begins as Mark's crew tries to rescue him after leaving him behind after a severe storm. Mark's crew members left him behind thinking that he died due to atmospheric pressure. However, Mark managed to survive using all the practical skills he acquired during college and training at NASA. Mark needed to survive 561 sols, or days, with the food he was left at the now abandoned Mars station. The same crew that left him are now aware of his survival, and try to rescue him. Mark makes contact with NASA on Earth and is informed of how many sols it will approximately take for the crew's voyage. Each day Mark journals the days he has left and the progress he makes of farming and rationing food. Somehow, Mark used all his resources efficiently for survival of 561 days until his crew returned for rescue. By the end Mark barely makes it out of Mars with his crew mates that initially stranded him there in the first place. 

This film is clearly well directly and detail oriented of each scene. The director did an entertaining job on the scientific knowledge a variety of different sciences such as botany, the study of plants. This was very important because Mars is considered arid and thought to be uninhabitable. His variety knowledge of chemistry and bacteria understanding helped him create water and food. ""You can't expect anything when you're there,"" was stated by Mark Watney to student astronauts by the end of the film. The movie clearly led up to that ending phrase since the audience did not know what other skill Mark would be hiding up his sleeve. The film indicated that they did the proper research with the book, making sure it was consistent for the film industry and the book readers. 

The Martian had qualities similar to Cast Away, where the protagonist is on a journey back home. These types of movies are important because they all derive from the Greek Iliad the Odyssey. The Martian took into a futuristic twist to its setting. This film definitely appeals to young male teenagers and all movie fans looking for a good adventure. Although in some scenes, my eyes began to get heavy, the Martian needed some improvements regarding their storyline. The ending was very predictable and I already knew from the beginning that Mark was going to be saved. I suppose the director attempted to keep consistent with the book, but not all films have to follow the structure of the book. I would recommend watching this film if you are interested in science and beautiful scenes. The pictures and scenes are beautiful, however there are very few plot twists. Plot twists are what keep an audience interested and awake. In an interview the director, Ridley Scott states that ""I'm a moviemaker, not a documentarian. I try to hit the truth."" From his film with the Martian, I can see how he tried to keep everything as realistic as possible. He made an accurate interpretation of our technology in the year 2050. From the small detailed to the NASA technology to the scenery of Mars, this film could honestly make the audience believe that this film is a documentary of the future.

4.0,"Sciencing the sh*t out of space exploration films, The Martian possesses more narrative gravity than well, Gravity, and presents a more stellar case for the continued funding of NASA than, well, Interstellar. Indeed, if Bill Nye took Creatine and went to Mars, it might look a lot like this. Rather than drift aimlessly in a dark vacuum, the film finds excitement and intrigue in MacGyver-esque problem-solving...if MacGyver got launched into space...and had an advanced botany degree. Regardless, minus Alien activity, The Martian ends up to be more exciting than director Ridley Scott's own Prometheus. Every bit as visually stunning, The Martian features truly organic thrills ratcheted up to a level 10.

In this PG-13-rated sci-fi actioner based on Andy Weir's bestselling novel, astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and gets left behind by his crew (Chastain, Michael Pena, Donald Glover) during a manned mission to Mars, so he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. 

Fact based and heavily researched, the science behind our astronaut's survival can't help but draw in even the least geeky filmgoer. Of course, this is what made the source material - Andy Weir's best selling novel - such an intergalactic smash. What the book took blows for, however, was a lack of development in regards to supporting characters. Here, screenwriter Drew Goddard rectifies this without ever pulling focus from the titular character. With a powerhouse lead performance like the one given by Matt Damon though, it's doubtless that any character could steal The Martian's red thunder. And this proves quite a claim given the A-List cast. Damon may have been last seen in a similar (albeit villainous) spacesuited role in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar but make no doubt about it: The Martian emerges as a far more entertaining and assured piece of filmmaking.

5.0,"I now know how long I can hold my breath. There is a several minute attempted space rescue scene where I almost passed out. Thankfully I realized I was holding my breath and snapped out of it. The Martian is one of the best movies of the year so far. Take a dash of the scientific problem solving miracle of Apollo 13, a spritz of the emotional feeling of hopelessness from Castaway, and add a skosh of the will to survive of Gravity and walla - you get The Martian. You know what else these films all have in common - they were great, and so is The Martian. I went in hoping it would be good, and it was better than that - more action than I expected, funnier than I ever imagined, and with 3D effects that will blow your mind.  
Matt Damon is Mark Watney, part of a crew that has set up camp and is exploring the surface of Mars. The crew is caught in a horrible storm and Watney is presumed dead. The commander (Jessica Chastain) regrets leaving his body, but to save the rest of her crew she has to take off - with no hope to return. But, hey - it's Matt Damon - and he's ALIVE! The problem is, the camp they established is set up for experiments and only has about a months worth of provisions. Plus, the storm took out all communication possibilities. Does it really matter? The next Mars mission isn't scheduled for years, so it's really just a matter of Mark choosing the manner of his demise. Except - except - as in Mark's words, ' I'm just going to have to science the shit out of this place'.
So now the movie takes on two fronts: Mark's efforts to communicate and stay alive: and once they know he survived, the political and moral decisions that have to be made by NASA and the bureaucracy that is our government. Both stories are brilliantly told and acted, not only by Matt Damon, but by one of the the best supporting casts in memory. A-listers galore inhabit big and small roles with gusto.
OK, so the science talk was way, way, way over my head, and the ending is a little weak - but that is really nit picking. I am not going to downgrade a 214 minute movie when the first 211 minutes were so outstanding. I have no idea if the science of The Martian is valid or not, but to me it didn't matter. Mark's ingenuity and will to survive, the brotherhood of his crew, the can-do spirit of space programs around the world, and the feeling that there are causes that can bring the world together make this an emotional experience you will both feel and remember. And to really remember it, see the 3D version.

4.5,"For the second year in a row, Matt Damon is stranded on a far away planet and needs a rescue. This year it happens to be Mars. Let me just say that this movie is brilliant and a thrill ride. Ridley Scott and Matt Damon make listening to scientific mumbo-jumbo enjoyable and teachable. Every second that Matt is stuck on Mars you empathize with his character and feel what he is feeling (the desolation and despair of being deserted on a planet with nothing and if you step one foot outside or have one misstep, you die). So much so that in the final climatic scene (extremely cheesy but nonetheless satisfying) you feel a huge sense of relief and happiness for his character. The only negatives I saw, were 1) that some of the cast seemed almost pointless or rarely used (I get it, the movie is not about them but Kristen Wiig had two lines and they almost seemed SNL-esque), and 2) that the ending scene was ridiculous and cheesy yet so cheerful and pleasing as an audience member. Overall, the cast was phenomenal and the special effects and CG were the best of any film this year. The story was pretty much air tight (you know I am a stickler for plot holes) and the scientific aspects coupled with the subtle humor in many lines make this easily one of my favorite movies of the year.

4.5,"Being a huge fan of director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Prometheus, Kingdom of Heaven) & Matt Damon (The Bourne Trilogy, Oceans Trilogy), I proclaim - put their names on anything & I will watch it! Eventhough in recent years, Ridley Scott movies have been more on the down side for example films like, Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings have been disappointments. But since the time I heard about the production of this film based on the novel by Andy Weir, a sense of excitement has stayed inside me & thanks to the positive buzz around the film, the excitement stayed intact. And guess what? As expected, this film is one of the best to come out this year! What Ridley Scott (Director), Drew Goddard (Screenwriter), Andy Weir (Book), and Matt Damon do with this movie is so unconventional and smile inducing, that it may redefine how some movies mix genres. I threw this under the category of Drama, but it wasn't a drama. I thought of possibly putting it under the comedy or thriller section, but the film is not a comedy or thriller nor is it just a mere mixture of genres to create a new Sci-Fi movie. So what am I trying to say? The film is a mixture of numerous elements that are authentically blended in a way that few movies can attest to. Consequently this makes it significantly harder to put a genre on it, but in this case, I think it's a good thing. As many people already have stated, I was instantly reminded of the movie ""Cast Away"", with Tom Hanks & to some extend 'Interstellar'. I loved Cast Away & Interstellar, but I don't see those film as optimistic journeys. Here, the depressing tones are solved by injecting a bit more humor and action into the film. Rather than Matthew McConaughey & Hanks' downbeat characters, Damon's character is far more upbeat and involved in his own rescue throughout the entire film. I definitely did not expect the humor that is present throughout the film. Whether it was script-writing, ad-libbing, or a combination of the two, it worked out quite well. This Ridley Scott film does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. The story follows botanist / astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon). Mark is part of the Ares III team also consisting of Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and astronauts Rick Martinez (Michael Pena), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). While the Ares III team explores Mars, a blinding particle storm forces them to abort their mission and board their ship. The storm violently separates Mark from the rest of the crew who are forced to leave without him, believing Mark dead. The crew is so convinced he's dead that when they communicate that fact to NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), he almost immediately arranges an honorary funeral for him. Of course, rumors of Mark's death are premature. Buried in sand, losing oxygen, and suffering a puncture wound, Mark is nevertheless alive. He manages to struggle back to the still-standing planet base, replenish air, equalize pressure, and treat his wound as best he can. However, the obstacles to his survival are just piling up. Can Mark fight Martian weather, radiation, cold, starvation, dehydration, and boredom at least long enough to somehow contact NASA to let them know he's alive, and then stay alive even longer for NASA to mount a rescue mission? Meanwhile, back on Earth, Teddy, NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), and NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) have their own challenges, both urgent and mundane. Besides naturally getting Mitch home safely, Teddy and his team must negotiate the usual treacherous PR protocol to make sure that Mark's inadvertent abandonment does not embarrass, discredit, and eventually defund NASA. Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, this film is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the film making craft and humanization elements present in his earlier films. And so the film oscillates among these scenarios and dilemmas and manages, in my opinion, to do it without boring and, if you'll excuse the expression, alienating the audience. How can a space movie without aliens, laser weapons, or aerial combat hope to do this? I think the film succeeds in this by being more knowledgeable than its audience, but in a way that instructs the audience without talking down to them. The movie explains many astrophysical, mechanical, and chemical concepts (including a crucial ""slingshot"" maneuver) that help keep the movie going forward and the audience invested in the characters' fates. It certainly helps that Damon's character Mark, in his daily video journal of his ordeals, explains much of this scientific stuff in largely (and often laugh-out-loud profane) layperson's terms. Scott's visual effects and grand scale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level. The film also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing. The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost my attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly! My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character. With its nearly two and a half hour run time, the film remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant here! This is easily his finest role since The Departed. You constantly laugh at his jokes, you are rooting for him to make it home, and you feel for him when he is starting to break down and go through his emotions. Most importantly, you care about his character and because of this, the audience gets sucked right on in for the ride. They become fully committed and invested into what is unfolding before their eyes and what is unfolding is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year and one of Ridley Scott's best work in a long time. Unlike Castaway's one-man show, the film boasts a huge cast that surprisingly never becomes over crowded. Besides Damon's amazing performance, the film boasts of a loaded cast - Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Micheal Pena, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Ejiofor in particular reminds all of us, why he was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor ! Every character was likable, even the CEO of NASA (Daniels) who is supposed to be the corporate boss we are all supposed to hate, we end up understanding why he makes the decisions he does throughout, and the film makes us think about what we would do if we had to make the difficult decisions that he is responsible for in his position. On the whole, 'The Martian' is a beautifully shot & well acted film which is definitely worth checking out in 3D.

5.0,"After watching the movie, ( The Martian 2015), I was very pleased that I spent to money to go do so. The movie takes place primarily on Mars, with Matt Damon being the main character. Damon and a group of astronauts are sent to Mars to do research and explore the planet. While there Damon is caught in a dust storm and the other crew members are forced to leave him behind. To their knowledge he was dead. This was not the case and soon Damon wakes up alone and stranded on Mars. He returns to their base camp and soon realizes that he will be there for quite some time. The people of NASA soon learn that he is not dead and start to formulate a plan to save him. The soonest they can get there is about three and a half years. Damon now has to be able to keep himself alive until help comes.
There first thing that comes to mind is the necessities; food, water and oxygen. He has very limited food and water. Back on Earth Damon was a botanist and was recruited to go on the mission due to knowledge in botany. He sets out to find suitable soil to grow food. It does not take long before he has his own homemade soil. He is very successful in his efforts to grow food until an explosion kills his garden of food. Damon is forced to ration out food until rescue comes. While he can communicate with NASA it is via text and takes some time. They work out a plan that consists of him traveling to a rocketship that happens to be on another side of the planet 2,100 miles away. This voyage takes him 50 days to complete. His launch is successful and he soon is reunited with his crew back aboard the main spacecraft. Their flight back home goes without an issue and once back home his is a national icon. He is the only man to have lived on Mars. Damon soon becomes a professor and relives his time on Mars by helping young astronauts. 
I believe that this movie was very believable for how extreme it was. It also kept my attention throughout the entire movie. Damon's dialogue with himself was very intriguing and entertaining. All characters played their role very well. The setting of the film being on Mars really interested me. We are starting to learn more and more about this planet and couldn't have had a better release time for this movie. The planet was very bare and dry but at the same time held some sort of mystical aura to it. I have not seen many images of the planet like this and was very eye opening for me. The special effects of the movie were great and quite a rush at times. The music and sound effects complemented the special effects very well. Overall the special effects, images and sound effects were spot on in the movie.
If there was one thing I would suggest changing, this would be the ending. It was very predictable but for some reason I always had the mindset that it would not be so. The Disney type ending does not fit all movies and this is certainly one it does not. His return home goes without a hitch. Although this is good for him it does not add much excitement to the movie. Some sort of obstacle on the way home would have given the audience one last chance to think that he was not gonna make it. Besides that I believe all aspects of the movie were very well done and a film I would recommend to anybody.",Taylor B,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 07, 2015",Taylor B,/user/id/914801310,RT,914801310,,The Martian

5.0,"I love this movie. This is a movie about a person who survived on Mars.

Mark Wartney played by Matt Damon was an astronaut and went to Mars with other NASA astronauts. .I liked the opening.The mars looked like very beautiful planet.It was a beautiful movie.After a storm, other astronauts escaped from Mars.Mark was left behind them on Mars.

Mark was extremely intelligent guy.He knew how to grow potato on Mars. Even he made ' water"".This was a great opportunity for me to learn some science.Mars is hot and cold. This movie uses ' Celsius"". Please use Celsius to Fahrenheit converter on your smart phone, if you are not familiar with Celsius.

I was wondering ""where did he buy the potato on the earth ""? I guess that he bought them at some Whole food market in Houston TX.Actually, People at Johnson space center in Houston TX tried to rescue him.

I liked an Asian Engineer Bruce Ngo played by Benedict Wang.Heformulated a plan to send a probe to Mars and resupply Mark to let him last the four years.While I was watching a movie, I really wanted to send Kata Robata's sushi, samurai Noodles' Ramen noodles and H-mart's Kimchi to him in Mars.These are the best foods in Houston TX.Sadly,  The probe exploded. And Mars's cold temperature destroyed Mark's potato filed  I was crying....

However, Math genius Rich Purnell's made a rescue plan China helped USA and sent a classified booster rocket.Other mars exploration mission team returned to Mars in order to save him. Next seven months, Mark had to eat his potatoes and dance alone with some music.

Mark  used the Chinese rocket and went to the space in order to meet his rescue team.His rescue team arrived near mars. Reunion of Mark and his rescue team was a climax of the movie. Finally, he went back to the earth.People around the world were rooting for Mark and his team!

People in Johnson Space center,Houston TX really helped Mark . I wish I could invite Mark Wartney to my favorite Genji sushi and Karaoke bar in Houston TX .He ate only Fucxxx potatoes for a year.he deserve enjoying  Karaoke and sushi at Genji in Houston TX!!!! You don't dance alone !

This is a great movie which I can recommend everyone to watch. Especially, People in Houston Texas should watch this movie.

3.5,"Orange You Glad You're Not Mark Watney?

The Martian is the latest film from legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, American Gangster). Matt Damon stars as the lovable Mark Watney, the sole astronaut marooned on the red planet whose crew risk life, limb, and the future of future NASA spaceflight to rescue him. Equipped with nothing but his conveniently extensive knowledge of chemistry, physics and botany, a can-do attitude, and enough one-liners to make a dedicated Twitter account; Watney must find a way to survive in the hostile Martian environment, 200 million kilometres from the nearest hot dog stand.

In order to properly critique this film I had to put aside my love for anything Ridley Scott, Matt Damon, space, science, mars, NASA, and the colour orange and view it for what it is: a good Endeavour, but a missed Opportunity. Upon seeing the first trailers for The Martian I was over the moon. Ridley Scott working with NASA to create a Hollywood blockbuster about Mars? Come on, they even got Neil deGrasse Tyson to do some mock intros. However as the credits rolled I found myself reminded of Scott's last venture into the sci-fi genre, Prometheus, a film with limitless allegorical and ontological potential that rolled and flopped in the primordial dust.

Scott, channelling the days of Black Hawk Down, breathes life into the compelling story by novelist Andy Weir. Unlike Down, however, The Martian fails to note the crucial fact that military correspondents, engineers, and rocket scientists do not make great authors. Screen writer Drew Goddard's adherence to the storyline and dialogue set out by Weir, thought dutiful, results in a script replete with awkward phrasing and chunky, obvious dialogue. The only mentionable deviation from the novel is a negative one: Martian initially flirts with the hard-R rating expected by readers by way of close-up self-surgery followed by a poignant ""fuck"", but the gore and expletives fail to reach escape velocity and are either implied or blatantly censored for the remainder of the film. The score comes off as mostly-overdramatic and Watney is forced to listen to nothing but 70s disco hits, which means (don't remove your space helmet) you are too.  Character development throughout the film is glacial and most of the actors are type-cast for variations of similar roles. Think Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty, Jeff Daniels in The Newsroom, Michael Peña in pretty much everything he's ever been in. Notably, Sean Bean goes light years outside of his artistic complex to play the furrowed-browed flight director who appears to be locked in a state of deep, unspoken emotional turmoil. In a moment of surgical tongue and cheek (or else a case of ""oh well, we've cast it now"") Bean sits broodingly in on a ""secret meeting"" code named ""Elrond"". The meeting is convened by top NASA scientists and officials in order to discuss what the hell they're going to do next whilst trying to avoid eye contact with Bean, lest he hold up a hand and say ""One does not simply intercept a resupply module while sling-shotting around the Earth via a gravity assist so as to travel back to Mars and dock with an abandoned crewmember...it is folly""  

Damon, eager to repair his rep as ""The Best of Us"", plays a convincing, though occasionally inaccessible Mark Watney. It's often tough to sympathise for his character, but this is due mostly to the predictability of the plot and the repetitive video narration in the majority of Watney's scenes. Pacing is critical in this year-long story and Martian takes from Castaway to show the passage of time. Cut to some 400 ""sols"" (one sol = 24.5 Earth hours) into the ordeal and an emaciated Damon with near DiCaps-level chin pubes saunters around his make-shift home and goes about his sol-ly routine. If you're still a bit overwhelmed by the procession there's a friendly ""sol"" counter to lead each Watney scene, and if the word ""sol"" is starting to get on your nerves well too bad, this is Mars and we're going for scientific accuracy. Don't expect some clever Wilson-esque plot device to thicken the script either. Rather than gluing some googly eyes on a potato to facilitate some one-sided rapport and establish a sense of loneliness, Watney chronicles all of his adventures on a video log; almost as if he knew someone would be watching.

Regardless, Martian promised to be a survival film for the nerds who walk among us and it does not disappoint. The film is heavily populated with sciencey tid-bits and ultra-high tech gadgetry and terminology. Those in the audience who tagged along with their friend or spouse because ""No, honey, I really do want to take an interest in your hobbies"" can tune out the big, smart people words without missing too much of the plot. Watney is usually helpful by providing some soliloquous dialogue for the laymen directly following some intense-sounding jargon (This is a Plutonium-238 radioisotopic thermoelectric generator. Translation: Scary bomb, bad) and if that's not enough, Watney will gratuitously read aloud text correspondences with NASA and various crewmembers. All the nerdy stereotypes are here, too. From the eccentric and socially awkward genius that crunches the numbers to save the sol, to the JPL laboratory staffed completely by Asians. The Martian does a good job of not selling the whole farm or patronising the audience, but if the science stuff feels a bit weighty just remember who the core demographic is meant to be.

In a sub-genre of Mars movies populated only by rusty, barren flicks like Mission to Mars, The Red Planet, and that one weird scene in Watchmen, The Martian is far and away the winner for scientific realism, compelling storytelling, and the triumph of the nerdy spirit. Though it misses the Mark in terms of depth and controversy, the films general theme is a successful one: it celebrates peopled-space flight, the scientific endeavour, and the yearning to understand our place in the Universe. Its release coincides with NASA's real-life finding of flowing water on the surface of the red planet, and it's heartening to see the popularity and excitement generated for future Mars exploration missions. The film stresses collaboration between people, government agencies, and world leaders. Ultimately, The Martian brings home one unavoidable fact: as human beings in a world steadily propelled by scientific discovery and innovation, our need for global cooperation and scientific literacy is ever greater; lest we be left in the dirt.",Mike T,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 07, 2015",Mike T,/user/id/824470548,RT,824470548,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/548385404/picture,The Martian

The Martian está basada en el libro de Andy Weir, y está dirigida por el gran Ridley Scott. Trata acerca del astronauta Mark Watney y como se encuentra solo en marte, luego de que su equipo, luego de una misión fallida lo da por muerto y se van. Watney despierta y está completamente solo. Con recursos limitados, tiene que conseguir la manera de sobrevivir, hasta que la NASA envíe una nueva misión en un par de años y pueda ser rescatado. Lo bueno, es que Watney siendo tan ingenioso y un respetado botanista logra lo imposible y sorprende al mundo entero.

The Martian es una película sólida. Me gusta que tiene un aspecto de comedia, que una situación similar a esta, nunca tendría. Un hombre solo en marte con la incertidumbre si va a sobrevivir, no es exactamente un panorama gracioso o esperanzador, pero la historia logra que esto sea posible, y es única. Con tantas películas en el espacio que son similarmente dramáticas, esta se destaca en ese aspecto. También está el hecho de que esta llena de modismos científicos, y no es necesario explicarlo al público, entonces se siente realista.

La dirección de Ridley Scott es impecable como siempre. Me sorprendió saber que dirigiría una adaptación, ya que él es uno de los prodigios quien es capaz de imaginar y ejecutar mundos utópicos y de magnitud increíble, pero lo logró, sin poner en riesgo su integridad como artista. Igualmente, la historia se mantuvo fiel a el libro, y de hecho creo que se traduce mucho mejor al medio audiovisual que en escrito, lo cual es uno de los mejores cumplidos que podría darle a esta película. Especialmente ver a marte en todo su esplendor, con esa vastedad naranja, es increíble.

4.5,"Ridley Scott directs a space version of Castaway as Matt Damon is abandoned on a strange, but beautiful red planet. 34 million miles away from home, a crew of highly trained astronauts are on the red planet extracting data and samples to take back home.  Then, a storm hits unexpectedly, which forces the crew to an early evacuation.  A series of unfortunate events leads the crew to leave Mark Watney (Matt Damon), a world-renowned botanist behind. This is where the movie really begins. He is forced to fight issue after issue to both stay alive and to communicate with earth while earth decides how they are going to save him.  

The premise of the movie is unoriginal, a race against time with obstacle after obstacle getting in the way. Where the movie does stand out though is it's seamless integration between scientific accuracy and compelling story line.  The star-studded cast delivers impeccable drama, but at times Damon has you laughing out loud. The cast: Chastain, Ejiofor, Pena, Mara, Wiig and Daniels is even joined for a brief but fun appearance from the Childish Gambino himself, Donald Glover.

4.5,"A solid space film. Although not as groundbreaking as Gravity or Interstellar which inevitably spring to mind as fellow recent big budget space movies, The Martian is well-realised. The Mars landscapes and the space travel scenes look the part, even if their relative gravities seems cheated. Matt Damon makes a likeable lead and the pseudo-science is delivered with enough conviction that it sells. Whilst weaved less successfully into the film than that of Guardians of the Galaxy, the unexpectedly incongruous soundtrack provides welcome comic relief and helps drive some character moments and the more traditional orchestral score is strong. The film felt long but I attribute this more to being immersed in the unfolding chain of events rather than it outstaying its welcome.

Think of this as a cross between Castaway and Apollo 13. What was great about those movies? The emotion. Here, there is no real emotion despite the potential. Think of the emotional journey of Tom Hanks in Castaway. This is basically the same story on a grander scale, but without the emotion, the humanity. The protagonist is a scientist, but not a regular human being going through what any human would go through in this situation. Was the problem in the casting someone in the central role with Hank's emotional range? the problem seems to be with all the characters  Was it the script? I could point to ""non emotion"" choices here such as keeping everyone's personal  relationships vague and off screen, both among crew and ground people and keeping out their personal lives.

3.0,"To be honest I felt that my efforts to see this film proved to be more dramatic than the action on the screen. 
A rainstorm meant a broken water main had rendered my intended route impassable. Undeterred, I headed in a different direction to another town that was showing this film about the Red Planet only for my hitherto trusted Alfa Romeo to grind to a halt. Still, not wishing to let my movie companion down, with Damonesque  determination I pressed on towards location number three.
In the belief that there was to be more to The Martian than just a space rescue story, I had deliberately avoided any reviews and entered the theatre in a rain-soaked coat not quite knowing what to expect, but hopeful of having my brain cells challenged. About an hour in, gently steaming in the heat of the theatre, I began to fear the worse. What was being played out was indeed just a space rescue movie. All the characters were very nice, even the Chinese chipped in, meaning there was no light and shade in the plot. Therefore, not for the first time, displaying a cussed nature, I found myself pulling against mainstream opinion. I began to resent the stranded Mark Watney for blindly assuming the world would unite in its endeavour to come to his assistance. See here's the thing: that's not how it works in real life Mark/Matt. It's a vital rule for all combatants or pioneers that the survival of the majority takes precedence over the survival of the individual. 
I don't want to appear totally heartless but this means that Mr Watney's remains should have been left to become powered in red dust. At least some nasty realist [why wasn't I called?] devoid of sentimentality should have argued such a case.
But not in this movie! In Disney-style, all risks were taken to salvage one astronaut. Sorry folks - save him if you must, but leave me out of it!
Yes, the effects were good. I found the music annoying and at no time was I on the Martian landscape alongside the beleaguered astronaut.

5.0,"Para traer a Matt Damon de vuelta de Marte, primero había que traer de vuelta a Ridley Scott del planeta de películas decepcionantes. El camino fue difícil, pero demonios, ¡sí que regresó!

El hombre detrás de esas pequeñas películas como Alien: el Octavo Pasajero, Blade Runner y Gladiador regresa haciendo una entrada triunfal con Misión Rescate. Durante una expedición de exploración en el planeta rojo, la tripulación es golpeada por una feroz tormenta. En medio del desastre, el astronauta Mark Watney (Damon) desaparece y se le presume muerto, por lo que el equipo toma la decisión de comenzar el viaje hacia la tierra. Sin embargo, contra toda expectativa, Watney sigue con vida y regresa al Hábitat (base de los astronautas en el desolado planeta). Luego de recuperarse, el protagonista debe ingeniárselas para sobrevivir en el hostil ambiente mientras busca la manera de contactar a la NASA.

Lo primero que se puede apreciar cuando inicia el film es que es visualmente fantástico. Aunque ya era inmensamente conocido que Ridley Scott es un director bastante visual, no nos deja de sorprender. Lo pudimos ver en films como Prometeo, que no cumplió con todas las expectativas, pero sí es una maravilla para la vista en todo momento. En Misión Rescate los paisajes del enrojecido mundo son verdaderamente un deleite para los ojos. El brillante uso de la atmósfera y el ambiente por parte de Scott se sienten durante todo el film y no desentona.
De ser posible, esta película tiene que ser vista en 3D. Okay, estamos de acuerdo en que la tecnología del 3D ha sido bastante decepcionante en la mayoría de las películas últimamente. Pero uno tiene que saber identificar cuándo hay más probabilidades de que realmente funcione (películas como Gravedad o El Sorprendente Hombre-Araña). Las tomas panorámicas de Marte son construidas con extremo cuidado. La superposición de capas y la profundidad (sin descuidar el detalle y la nitidez) de la imagen provoca verdaderamente una experiencia envolvente.

Si alguien tenía dudas sobre el talento de Drew Goddard (Monstruoso, Guerra Mundial Z, Daredevil), ésta película las aplasta. El talentoso guionista hace un majestuoso uso del ambiente de Marte y lo convierte en un personaje más de la historia. La atmósfera juega un rol imprescindible en el desarrollo narrativo y le da al espectador un ritmo y paso que trabajan tan bien como los engranajes de un reloj. Debo reconocer que antes de ver este film esperaba un tono mucho más serio. Sin embargo, el avance de la historia está acompañado por inteligentes dosis de humor, con excelente tiempo y precisión, sin quitar nada de la experiencia principal. Bravo, Goddard.

Un film con el argumento de naufragio debe apoyarse fuertemente en un talentoso y efectivo intérprete principal y Matt Damon lo logra a la perfección. Haciendo un despliegue de una gran versatilidad, el actor provee una interpretación poderosa y absorbente. No importa si es en escenas cargadas de peso dramático o en las simpáticas secuencias cómicas, Damon explora una sensibilidad psicológica al desenvolverse en el exigente rol.
Y porque detrás de todo gran actor principal hay grandes actores secundarios, ésta película los tiene por montones. En el film hay dos grupos de reparto (la tripulación en el espacio y el equipo de la NASA en la Tierra) que funcionan de forma genial gracias al talento de cada uno al momento de encender una gran química. El equipo del espacio encabezado por Jessica Chastain, quien le inyecta una sensibilidad dramática palpable a la historia, recae en Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara y Aksel Hennie. Cada uno, obviamente, añade un aspecto especial al desarrollo narrativo, aunque los personajes de Stan y Hennie son menos explorados que los demás.
El reparto de la tierra está liderado por Jeff Daniels y Chiwetel Ejiofor, ambos entregando lo mejor de su repertorio al representar la tensión y la gravedad del argumento. El resto del equipo está en manos de Sean Bean (lo siento, pero debo decir este SPOILER: ¡No muere!), una sorprendentemente cómoda Kristen Wiig, Mackenzie Davis (siempre agradable de ver en pantalla) y Donald Glover en un brillante papel. Hay un momento humorístico en el tercer acto en el que Ejiofor está simplemente brillante.

Si hay algo negativo que decir del film es que, por lo menos en mi opinión personal, el soundtrack del film provocó una pequeña distensión entre el tono y el paso inicialmente, pero después de un rato se moldea adecuadamente al avance por lo que no es un gran problema.

Y finalmente... el Señor Scott. Si Mad Max: Furia en el Camino fue el show de George Miller, éste es el show de Ridley Scott. Este año ha sido uno excelente para los regresos esperados, aquellos que vuelven a la base y nos logran encantar una vez más. Con sólo un film tal vez sea temprano para celebrar el regreso de Scott, pero no se puede negar de ninguna forma que éste un espectacular punto de partida.",Rodrigo G,False,False,False,True,5.0,"Oct 07, 2015",Rodrigo G,/user/id/971531047,RT,971531047,,The Martian

5.0,"I've been following this project ever since I heard Andy Weir speak on a podcast. Read the ebook loved it. Found out my favourite scriptwriter, Drew Goddard was attached. Got hyped. Found out my favourite director, Ridley Scott, was going to helm it. Just lost it. This is all of my favourite things put in one neat bundle. Great direction, great script, great visuals and great acting all around. The humorous yet intense story of a man against all odds. Yet, it is the NASA's side of story which separates this movie from the rest. Science was meant to progress humanity into the next era. Abandoning Mark Watney on Mars meant abandoning that very humanity. In a world that's moving towards darker and grittier movies, it's just great to see this gem where everyone works to bring one life back home, no matter the cost. Ridley Scott's ability to sway from stereotypes shines here as people of several race, gender and nationalities just discuss problem solving without any of that playing a factor. No clear cut bad moustache-man here, just business-men and scientists trying to make the best out of the situation.

3.5,"Better than we've seen from Scott in a while.  The Martian starts out with a basic action scene, which is jarringly out of place before settling into the character study that fills most of the rest of the running time, but I understand why it has to be there.  Matt Damon is the focus for most of the rest of the film, and while comparisons will invariably be drawn to Cast Away and Moon, I think he makes it his own.  It's a good thing he's so charismatic, because some of the ""funny"" lines he has to deliver would be truly groan inducing delivered by most other actors.

The main thing I would criticize is the CGI.  It is surprisingly subpar for a mainstream release with a well-known director.  Everything looks fake to a degree that is distracting at times.  Considering how advanced CGI is these days, that's unacceptable.  The other main problem is the uninspired cinematography, which is surprising coming from the guy who did Prometheus and Pirates of the Caribbean.  The way he pans over the Martian landscapes and shows the space scenes do not convey at all the utter loneliness of Damon's character or the vastness of space.  This is partially because of the aforementioned bad CGI, but more because he doesn't seem to have a sense of depth or where he should be having the audience focus.  I'm not sure why it happened, since most cinematographers have extensive experience nowadays working with green screens.  Third, the sense of time.  Now this is hard to fix in a film that's already over two hours, but the whole saga takes well over a year.  That simply is not conveyed well.  Days fly by, and at times the screen will wipe through whole weeks or months, but it does so perfunctorily, so that you do not appreciate the desperate struggle Watney has fought to get to where he is.  Hell, a 3200 kilometer trip passes by in ten minutes!  I know I could give Scott a pass here, but so many films have managed to give the passage of time gravitas, so I don't understand why he wasn't able to do that here.

Frankly, it seems as if The Martian was rushed out the gate very quickly, perhaps to avoid conflicting with other movie releases later in the season.  From rights sold, to casting, to production and release has taken a very short time, and it shows. Yet, despite these glaring problems (and to a lesser extent the schmaltzy ending), it's still a solid film, mostly bolstered by the acting which is almost universally on point.  Since this is a character driven drama, that goes a long way towards making this watchable.  Still, you can't help but get a sense when the film finishes that there's something missing, whether it's depth, awe, or just a little more attention to detail.  The final product is a good but not necessarily cohesive whole.",Alexander Z,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 06, 2015",Alexander Z,/user/id/811114811,RT,811114811,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/9010688/picture,The Martian
3.5,"There's not a whole bunch to complain about The Martian, in fact, it succeeds more than it doesn't, but what it succeeds in is overshadowed by the prominent focus of Matt Damon's character's isolation on deserted Mars. Whereas that is the highlight for many viewers, who simultaneously praise Damon for his acting--a sentiment I do not share--I found the drama brewing on planet Earth to be more substantive, complex, and engaging.

Survival stories usually up the ante through the environment in which they place their protagonists. If we look to a similar and recently released film, Gravity, space is not an easy place to survive, especially with all that debris and lack of atmosphere. Castaway threw the elements at Tom Hanks and Wilson, as did Alive, with its frigid temperatures and unspeakable consequences. And a look at any horror film tosses in endless possibilities and the odds of dying at everything on and off-screen. The Martian has a different plane, Mars. We come to know Mars has no life, save for Damon and his crops, and it's populated by hills and dusts storms and unsustainable atmosphere for humans, but that's about it. Throughout the film there is a sense that Matt Damon's survival will not end on Mars, there was no danger he faced that was grave enough to send me thinking, he's going to meet his end on the red planet. Because of this, the scenes that took us to Mars were plot advancing and meant for character development and characterization, yet somehow, the movie failed to capitalize on these two fronts to yield great results.

Matt Damon's character is refreshingly optimistic about his situation. He's an astronaut and scientist--a botanist--so his chances at survival are surely greater than your regular-non-space-travelling-human. But this optimism is hardly ever challenged to substantive levels. Yes, Damon's character encounters hardships, but they are undercut by quick fixes and comedic timing that is ever-so-present, that it becomes frustrating as the movie continues and not all that funny. There is also a big emphasis on the physicality of Damon, who spends a noticeable portion of the film baring his strong physique and the transformation that one undergoes when forced to ration food supplies. Yet, that transformation never crosses the physical to the personal. His character is a one-note performance and written similarly. What I greatly appreciated was that fact that Martian forwent a family subplot. There was little schmaltz in the Martian, which may have lent the film a little drama, but unnecessarily so, the drama was not in family, but in politics. What was not appreciated were the hints at familial and relationship drama. 

Throughout the film, there were hints at a relationship between Damon and another character, that turned out to be false, which irked me because the story used this angle to build up emotional resonance that, in the end, served no use. The drama involving NASA and attempts at a rescue mission for Damon was where the movie truly excelled. It may have been due to Ejoifor and Daniels' performances, whom in my opinion, outshined the rest of the cast, but the tactics, shortfalls, complexities, and challenges that the characters on Earth faced, seemed more deleterious to their success than the challenges Damon faced. Where the movie proved to be interesting was in the ethical and moral conundrums of how important was Damon's rescue and what means should be taken to make his rescue speedy, probable, and safe. Does NASA spend millions of dollars and many manhours to save a single person or continue its plans at scientific exploration, furthering our understanding of the worlds beyond Earth? How many corners should we cut to save him as soon as possible? Is there a better way to rescue him? The movie asks, and answers, these questions sufficiently and in a, mostly, satisfying manner, again due to the exchanges of Daniels' rational, no nonsense, deadpan delivery and Ejiofor's caring sensibility. The two characters are written as foils, but acted out perfectly. But aside from the drama building on Earth, cliched characters, contrived dialogue and writing work to diminish the best parts of the film.

Childish Gambino's (Donald Glover) appearance was unfortunately unnecessary, cliched, and poorly executed. From the moment we are introduced to him in his environment it is obvious what role he will play and it is a role that has been overdone. Whatever comedic relief he supplied to the audience, was lost on me because it's a character that lives on in so many films it becomes a bore to see its appearance. What seemed to be rushed was the plotline involving the NCSA and the willingness of their help, only because of the competition of the ""space race"" and the relations between the two nations. It seemed unlikely for there to be such a speedy resolution. Possibly because China is now a huge market for Hollywood films. Possibly and I think most likely. Not only that, but many attempts to stir up drama did not work, i.e. the entire last 30 minutes of the movie, because the drama, much like the false familial/relationship subtext served no purpose. It was in this place that really undid the movie as it showed the movie did not have the heft it believed it did. Luckily, the Martian is shot beautifully, though were not mesmerizing. The shots of Mars, the way the sand moved when disturbed, and landscape scenes are all beautiful and emphasize the loneliness of Damon. But more importantly, they highlight how different Mars is, yet showing the similarities of Earth.

The Martian, at its debut, is a film that wastes no time, no scene is unimportant, but that changes as the film goes on. It begins off beautifully but is let down by a middle and end act that cannot live up to its premise. Although the Martian focuses on an underwhelming lead character (due mostly, in my opinion, to Damon's acting abilities), Ejiofor and Daniels shine in their roles. It doesn't live up to the hype, not that the hype had any effect, but it surely isn't a waste of time. It's an enjoyable and entertaining time at the cinema, but not an experience that will be remembered for a lifetime.

4.5,"If Gravity was the thrill ride and Interstellar the emotional journey, then THE MARTIAN is the crowd pleaser with attitude. Based on the best-selling book, this has to be one of the most faithful adaptations to be put on screen. Everything from the dialogue and humor in the book is translated to the screen effortlessly. What we get is one of Matt Damon's best performance and one of Ridley Scott's best work  in a while. The scenes in NASA are as interesting as the scenes on Mars. The ensemble cast delivers as the film is funny, emotional, fun, and a lot of disco music. This is also a very nerdy film with a lot of science talk and survival skills being put to good use. For once, there is a film that makes being an engineer, astronaut, or botonist a cool thing to be. Even if you read the book, the movie will keep you in suspsense and entertained all at once.

3.5,"""That's so crazy, it just might work,"" is a hokey line used in a lot of bad movies that no one in real life has ever uttered.  ""The Martian"" is a good movie that tip-toes right around saying it about ten times.  We are introduced to plenty of stressful ""no way out"" situations that are pretty quickly conquered with a crazy makeshift plan; rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.  That being said, I must reiterate that the formula works to a certain extent and you hardly realize it was happening until you leave the theater.  Thankfully, the film treats us to another solid entry in the recent renaissance of modern space adventures.

It's not as thrilling as ""Gravity,"" or adventurous as ""Interstellar"" or as funny as ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" it still works on its own merit, almost feeling like warm mixture of the three.  To be honest, the opening scene of the movie had me worried.  We are given a crew of astronauts just going about their business on Mars, happily quipping away at each other with painfully hacky lines and none of the chemistry of truly great ensemble cast; it feels like someone had just seen ""The Avengers"" and thought, hey I can write fun banter like that, only to find that in order for it to work, we have to know even the tiniest bit about the characters for context and the lines also have to be funny.

Luckily, we get on with the story very quickly: a storm rolls through and Matt Damon gets left behind, boom, on to the good part of the movie.  Damon is an odd actor for me.  He isn't flashy but he's also not very subtle.  He's always just sort of a dude.  When he tries flashy, it comes off as fraudulent, and when he tries subtle, it's just boring.  So why do we like Matt Damon?  Why is he in so many movies (as a leading man, mind you) if he's so seemingly average?  What it comes down to is exactly what he displays in ""The Martian:"" he's got charm.  You can't help but smile and root for Matt Damon, he just looks so damn earnest.  

There are plenty of intense and charming scenes of him alone on Mars and while we never truly fear for his life (because if he died the movie would be over) we do get stressed about how awful his situation continues to be.  We periodically check back in with the folks on Earth who are all yelling different science facts and mathematical figures at each other with lines that feel like they were written by Aaron Sorkin's less talented twin brother.  We also occasionally check in with Damon's crew who are still on their way home through space, who also fail to do anything that interesting and you find yourself sitting in the theater wondering when the story will cut back to Mars.

We would all like to assume that if we were faced with any of the situations, we would be just as genius, just as sexy and just as witty as every single character is in every single scene of ""The Martian,"" which in a way, makes this movie the most ""Hollywood"" of any of the previously mentioned space adventures, and that doesn't make it a bad thing but the insane attractiveness of every character might make it a little difficult to get totally sucked in.

The Martian is pretty thrilling in the beginning and definitely thrilling at the end, with a beautiful, yet intensely daunting finale nearly on the level of ""Gravity.""  Damon crushes it, mainly just talking to GoPro cameras, and is a great rock foundation to build the rest of the movie on, despite that nothing ever gets quite as good as his scenes, but those sequences on Mars and the finale are worth the price of admission alone.  It is never a bad movie, but there are times you wish it was just a little better.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't surprise you to hear a character to say ""when this is all over, I'll expect your letter of resignation,"" but hey, at least it doesn't have Anne Hathaway explaining that love is stronger than science.",Spencer H,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 06, 2015",Spencer H,/user/id/785542451,RT,785542451,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/659040569/picture,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is a beautifully constructed sci-fi film.  Everything from the directing to the acting to the editing, it all just works.  It plays its tone very well, in what could be a depressing film of hopelessness we instead get a story of hope and survival with a surprising sense of fun and humor.  There's still some insanely tense moments that'll have you holding your breath, but they aren't the point of the movie.  It's a movie about a smart guy stuck in a crappy situation, and to survive he has to science the s*** out of it.
The movie benefits from really smart casting.  We are thrown into the story pretty quickly without much chance to learn the background of each character.  A brief text blurb will tell us who they are, but that's about all we get.  The movie seems to use our familiarity with the cast to it's advantage here.  The most obvious being Matt Damon in the lead.  We don't know who this guy is, but we need to like him and want him to survive.  Matt Damon is an infectiously likable guy, so this works.  The rest of the star-studded cast follows a similar form.
The movie also has beautiful direction.  Ridley Scott has spent a lot of time making fictional worlds look beautiful, so it stands to reason he could make a real world look gorgeous too, and boy does he ever.  I've never wanted to visit Mars before, but now I kind of do.  Maybe not the message I'm supposed to get from the movie, but hey, it looks damn pretty.

5.0,"You can't really call this a sci-fi movie, since these events in it could actually happen, and may happen before the end of our lifetime. But the truth is The Martian isn't based on any true story yet--although I kept having to remind myself of that. Of course it would all be more impressive and meaningful if it were--like Apollo 13 for instance. It's this odd ""not quite sci-fi"" aspect that makes Ridley Scott's newest project a little different. It's easy to accept the different script beats when we're watching a film where we're encapsulated so much by the unique concept and universe, but when viewing something that COULD be real yet isn't, we may be likely to say to ourselves, ""Hmm, I wonder why the filmmakers chose to do that."" Not to say that The Martian is predictable, but it does lack a certain ""so crazy that it has to be true"" element--because it's not true, and it's really not crazy if you think about what we could accomplish in the next 50 years or less.

The Martian is a film about a manned Mars mission where a series of events lead 5 crew members to believe that their sixth member (Matt Damon) is indeed dead. They leave him behind and head home. Meanwhile, NASA discovers that Damon's character, Mark Whatney, is actually alive, but they can't afford for his crew to turn around and get him because they wouldn't have enough resources to elongate the trip.

It's a star-studded cast featuring, alongside Damon, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, et al. The acting is terrific, and on a technical level this film is nearly perfect.

It may not take enough risks for some of the more macabre members of the audience, but it never bothers me as it's refreshing to get some representation of yesteryear in film. It's pretty Spielberg-esque in the sense that it's not very dark and nothing truly unpredictable happens--since, really, we haven't enough knowledge in order to predict what would happen. It's a subject that not many laypersons know about. But (spoiler alert) there aren't any surprise alien encounters or anything like that. Given the limited information we have, we can foresee certain possibilities ahead of time. But The Martian is such a unique film that we love every minute of it. We live so vicariously through Damon's character that it makes the journey feel so much more real. 

Some of the banter between scientists becomes pretty heavy, but I applaud it for making the situations understandable without dumbing it down.

It's just a pleasing film to watch and has a classic cinema quality to it. It's a little long at nearly 2 and a half hours, but it never seems to drag, and the length serves to emphasize the perenniality of Whatney's marooning. 

It's one of the best films of the year, and one of the most well done movies you'll see in recent years. It will be hard to find someone who doesn't recommend this one.

4.0,"The Martian tells the story of Maatt Damon, in his second outing in recent years as an astronaut (see Interstellar) only this time, he doesn't attempt to outwit Matthew McC. He's presumed dead after a freak storm in which his crew leave him for the safety of a trip home, but he is very much alive. Damon spends the rest of the film sciencing the shit out of Mars to survive while NASA figures out a way to bring him home. This film is rare in that it is worth the hype. Yes, we've all seen the marketing campaign but trust me, this film is fun. It is a tinge on the long side but those of us who love space, science, and astronomy will have a ball. You've also got Jeff Daniels who is a crusty NASA administrator, and Sean Bean who doesn't die for once, plus a cast that includes... ahh.. Kate Mara (do DO do DOO do) and Jessica Chastain, also of Interstellar fame. The film is entertaining, it puts you on the edge of your seat many times, and it's very technically interesting. Rest assured, if NASA ever does send man to Mars, something will go wrong, and Matt Damon will be there to science it up. Beefs I had with this film include (spoiler) the sudden lack of interest in the Chinese rocket that helped, plus the time it takes to communicate between the two planets is in no way a few seconds. Sure there are some unbelievable moments but that doesn't mean the film is any less entertaining. Just make sure the jerk in front of you doesn't talk the whole damn film like when I saw it. Look out for Katniss in the previews, and another Lawrence/Cooper flick that looks kind of stu. Also check out the preview for a stu Christmas movie that can't decide whether it is a comedy or a horror film, and Leo getting old and crusty while playing sweaty nut-sac in the cold woods.

4.5,"The Martian is the newest film from legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner), and it's undoubtedly his best work in years. Adapted from Andy Weir's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, the film boasts an ensemble cast of some of the biggest names in Hollywood-Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Donald Glover, do I need to keep going? Though one big thing that  practicality plays a vital role in the film, one thing audiences can expect from The Martian is jaw-dropping, Oscar-caliber special effects. I don't typically see films in 3D (I'm cheap and it usually doesn't make much of a difference), but if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks, I'd recommend it this time around. The alluring reddish landscape of Mars pops off the screen beautifully, and the tense scenes in space will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.The Martian is not a deeply philosophical film, nor is it one that requires much critical thinking.

Matt Damon I think will get a Best Actor nod here and he should.  Last year we had Gravity as our lost in space kind of movie and this is better then that.  The cast on earth is very good and reminded me a bit of Apollo 13 and trying to get things done to help out this guy stranded on Mars.  There's some science lessons here, and unlike Interstellar (which I loved and still like a little more then this), it's much easier to follow since they are scientific facts and not theories.

3.0,"Gostar ou não de um filme vai muito além de suas qualidades técnicas ou criativas. Depende, em grande parte, da sua expectativa em relação ao que espera ver no cinema. Ridley Scott + Matt Damon + Sci-fi.... dá pra entender que a expectativa é enorme. Não esperava nada menos do que 5 estrelas. Mas ao contrário do recente Interstellar, do Nolan, Scott não consegue entregar.

A história em si é fantástica e Damon domina a tela. O elenco de suporte é ótimo, direção de arte impecável e uma bonita fotografia. O problema é o roteiro desequilibrado e o abuso dos clichês. Imagine: Você é largado em um planeta inóspito, completamente sozinho, sem possibilidade de comunicação, com poucos recursos e nenhuma perspectiva de resgate. Esperamos uma carga dramática pesada, mas o filme é quase uma comédia (prova disso é a escalação da Kristen Wiig). E não estou falando dos necessários alívios cômicos, a comédia está presente em praticamente todas as sequencias, e alivia demais o drama. Sem mencionar os clichês clássicos, um giro pelo mundo afora com pessoas reunidas nas ""time squares"" da vida acompanhando o desenrolar dos erros da NASA através de telões gigantes.... sério Scott? Sem contar a trilha sonora horrível (só uma pessoa podia levar arquivos de música para Marte?), bandeiras americanas para todos os lados, todo mundo batendo palmas o tempo todo.... entre outros clichês clássicos.

Mas, ainda assim, no geral o saldo do filme é positivo. Como eu disse no começo, tudo depende da expectativa. Não espere um filme na linha Alien ou Prometheus.

4.5,"Just watched ""The Martian"" in Gold Class at Crown in Melbourne.
So good to see the legendary Ridley Scott, from ""Alien"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Hannibal"" fame, back at the helm. Ridley sure knows how to put together a complex project and create a masterpiece on completion, which he certainly accomplished with this latest effort. This movie was actually based on the science fiction novel and the first published novel by American author Andy Weir.
Matt Damon, played the part of NASA astronaut Mark Watney, who after problems with disastrous weather on the surface of Mars with 4 of his colleagues, found himself left stranded with only enough food & rations to last a few months. The problem with that was that the next mission back to Mars was in 4 years time!
Matt never fails to disappoint with his performances and was perfect for this role.
Jeff Daniels, from ""Dumb and Dumber"" fame, played the part of NASA Director Teddy Sanders back in Heuston. This was a very different role for Jeff, that required a somewhat aloof, serious, snooty and condescending persona. He really nailed this performance and showed us all just how versatile he is.
Chiwetel Ejiofor, from ""12 Years a Slave"" fame, played the part of Venkat Kapoor, a NASA communications expert. This gentleman just seems to be improving with age and it really won't be long before he is rewarded at Oscar time for his craft.
Sean Bean, played the role of Mitch Henderson, another NASA aficionado, who didn't agree with the director's plan of attack to go back and retrieve Mark Watney from Mars. Sean added his usual tough-guy, machismo and authoritarian flavour to the movie and did a top job.
Jessica Chastain, played the part of Melissa Lewis, the leader of the mission to Mars that lead to Mark Watney being left behind. Jessica also starred in Hollywood blockbusters ""Interstellar"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"". She certainly gave the feminists and Germaine Greer followers out there something to cream themselves about with her very strong performance as the head decision maker on board the Mars space craft.
I don't want to spoil the storyline with my review so what I will say is that it isn't 'old hat' and delivers some fantastic action combined with special special effects that keep you both interested and in suspense. And as always, Matt Damon injected a bit of humour too, that lightened things up a bit from time to time.
One thing I did appreciate as a teacher and fan of Mathematics and Science is when Mark Watney realized he was going to need to survive longer on Mars than what his supplies would allow him. The line that stuck in my mind was...
""I'm going to need to Science the sh!t out of this!!!""
But it wasn't just Science that saved his derrière, Mathematics also played a huge part in calculating how in the hell he could get back to Mother Earth in one piece.
I always like to say I wish I had a dollar from every time a student has asked me, whilst teaching them algebra, trigonometry or calculus...
""Mr Winter, when I am I ever gonna use this??""
Well kids BOOM, just check out ""The Martian""!!!
My stock answer, of course, after explaining all the careers along with astronauts, that need it, is...
""Well Johnny, to pass the next test son!!""
In closing, ""The Martian"" was an absolute gem, Louise and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was action packed, believable and an awesome spectacle.

Firstly, I went into the theater thinking I was gonna watch Hotel Transylvania 2... then this nonsense starts. That's an automatic one star right there.

5.0,"""The Martian"" stars Matt Damon as an astronaut who is presumed dead after he is caught in a debris storm on Mars. However, he comes to and desperately tried to figure out how to survive and make contact with NASA. Damon is brilliant in the role and takes his situation in stride often resulting in comedic moments. I can honestly say this is the first best picture contender of 2015. This film is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and acted resoundingly well. I could see Oscar potential for this movie in the acting, cinematography, and visual effects categories among others. I did not expect this film to be outstanding but it was. There are no dull moments even in Damon's seclusion on Mars. He is well supported by Jeff Daniels and Jessica Chastain.

5.0,"I was captured for ""The Martian"" from beginning to end, the something more than two hours passed inadverted. The film has the reasonable and coherent elements of Sy Fy films but the adventure and drama elements also were well balanced during the plot.

4.0,"Normally I would be negatively biased towards promoting a movie from Ridley Scott, not in this case however. One thing that must be noted is that ""The Martian"" is absolutely gorgeous with its cinematography and that there is a clear emphasis on it through out the film. Storytelling is quite simple but significantly interesting and entertaining with the mixture of science and thrill. Of which sent me to wondering and excited for what Matt Damon was going to do next to survive. In terms of performances, the movie specifically geared towards Matt Damon whom was exceptional in his part with the rest of the main cast done so respectably.

0.5,"The most politically-correct movie of the year.  That's why the critics love it.  It's also the most boring movie of the year.  And it's stupid too.

2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and NASA discussing how to rescue him.

It is NOT an intelligent movie.  In fact, I lost brain-cells while watching this.  A 22-year-old model woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon.  A 22-year-old slob who twitches and looks like he's strung-out on drugs is the only one at NASA smart enough to know about using a slingshot effect to propel a rocket.  The scene where this dude goes into the highest level meeting, in street clothes....and then demonstrates the slingshot-effect while acting like a totally immature nerd, making weird sounds like ""beep-beep-beep""....but they are all awed by his tremendous intelligence....I nominate this scene for dumbest scene of the year.

Every scene alternates between someone of a different race, with every race included.  Every scene has a woman in it too.  A woman is the commander of the space mission.

4.0,"Não desmerecendo o trabalho do Nolan e equipe, de forma alguma, mas a adaptação de ""Perdido em Marte"" (de Ridley Scott) - que chegou aos cinemas quinta-feira passada - consegue algo que ""Interstellar"" não conseguiu plenamente: ser acessível ao público, embora apresentem finalidades diferentes enquanto bons blockbusters de ficção científica. 
Brincar de cientista, digamos, nunca pareceu tão sofisticado e interessante como agora. O tom bem-humorado e razoavelmente leve da trama mantém o público entretido, enquanto constrói a tensão para momentos específicos. Além disso, Ridley e os responsáveis por escalarem o elenco foram extremamente cautelosos ao trazerem para as telas o que há de melhor: diversidade, da forma mais natural possível - como deveria ser.
Quanto ao uso do 3D, para os adeptos à tecnologia, embora bom, pois engrandece a imersão do espectador em paisagens muito bem construídas, pode ser deixado de lado sem maiores problemas.

4.5,"The Martian takes the space thrills of Gravity and mixes in the heart-rending isolation and battles against adversity of Cast Away to produce a modern sci-fi classic. Despite its alien setting, The Martian is a very human story - of fortitude, compassion, ingenuity and the dogged determination to survive. There are thrills and spills to keep the blockbuster contingent happy - and they are done well - but it's the quieter reflective moments that makes this film stand out. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the charismatic Everyman - who against all odds maintains a plucky attitude and wit as the days and weeks pass by. This unexpected sense of humour peppered throughout (alongside an ingeniously juxtaposed 70s disco soundtrack) gives The Martian a fresh and believable take on a familiar premise.

3.5,"One of many recent stranded-in-space movies (GRAVITY; INTERSTELLAR), but one of the most critically well-received, THE MARTIAN brings Ridley Scott comfortably back to plausible yet fantastic story-telling. Unlike GRAVITY, THE MARTIAN is interested in specific goals that the human spirit can aspire to. Unlike INTERSTELLAR, THE MARTIAN makes arguments about reasonably immediate action mankind can take to advance their knowledge - namely, beginning work to make Mars inhabitable. While areas of THE MARTIAN are still science fiction to us for now, the possibility of its story to become a future trajectory is not so fantastic that it is out of the question. Ultimately the movie ends up boiling down to being a triumph of the human spirit story, but that message almost never tires. The kicker is whether or not that theme is explored in new and interesting ways... which it mostly succeeds at. 
THE MARTIAN is an interesting cross of several plot types that play out a bit like CAST AWAY in space. Fortunately, space is cool and Matt Damon is a talented leading man. Damon's ability to feel when and how to bring humor versus seriousness and intensity is no doubt the key cinematic ingredient that makes the whole movie work. Additionally, Ridley Scott brings his A-game to the direction. Scott's pacing keeps the movie feeling energetic and immediate, phenomenologically off-putting the daunting 2 and half hour run time of the picture. The excellent cinematography and editing make the film more watchable than it seems like it would be on paper. 
Even with stellar (ha!) performances from the supporting cast, though, the impressive ensemble is largely overlooked. A few key junctures give Daniels, Ejiofor, Pena, and Chastain moments to shine, but these moments are limited and seem to almost waste the available talent. Donald Glover, who I normally like very much, comes in as an overly stereotypical and absurd young genius toward the end of the film. His acting choices do not well match the aesthetic of the rest of the movie and only served to pull me out of the narrative. 
Overall, THE MARTIAN is a refreshingly excellent film for Scott and Damon. I expect Damon - who lost a significant amount of weight (in a method-like preparation) for the role - will get some Oscar talk. Whether this buzz will clench the nomination still seems very uncertain at this point, though. Either way, Damon gives a compelling performance and his work alone is enough to make the movie worthwhile.",Kyle H,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 05, 2015",Kyle H,/user/id/896629999,RT,896629999,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000555088049/picture,The Martian

3.5,"A right-brained survival story with our celestial sea as its backdrop, watch Ridley Scott and Matt Damon construct a solid adaptation of the novel with enough edge and wit to entertain without pandering into Space Mountain.

With many cinematic elements to admire, from the production design, cast, and direction, The Martian hits nearly every beat on its journey.  My only comment, is the edit needed to give time for its characters to (no pun intended) breathe, for more emotional context paired with obstacles along the way.

Whereas 'Gravity', or 'Saving Private Ryan' (Hey! Same guy) rely heavily on emotional manipulation, The Martian shares DNA more with Castaway and the underrated 'All is Lost', to leverage indelible human survival traits such as teamwork, ingenuity, imagination, and DIY botany.

4.0,"Doesn't try to reach the emotional levels of interstellar, or the intensity of Gravity, but it succeeds in being pure entertainment, done at a high level with a great cast, never getting too sciency, yet still not being too implausible (at least to my unlearned science mind) and moving at a fast pace. If you have to watch someone act by themselves on a planet and basically just talk to the audience, you cant get much better than matt damon, who is loaded with charisma, can be quite funny, and you cant help but root for him, the story back on earth at NASA is also well done and even suspenseful at times, thanks to a lot of high quality actors in the roles, while the other story (the rest of Marrk's crew) probably has the least screen time, their scenes are still effective, then again I love Jessica Chastain and am very biased XD plus it has an all disco soundtrack, including my favorite band ABBA, so that's obviously a plus, overall it may not be anything that new or exciting, but what it does it does very well and I definitely enjoyed myself watching it",Daniel S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 05, 2015",Daniel S,/user/id/788813831,RT,788813831,,The Martian

For starters the Martian is an intelligent movie. It's certainly oversimplified at times and takes one too many liberties with science but it does things very well too. For one, it's the kind of movie where being geeky and nerdy is cool. Knowing stuff is important and having a grasp of science is valuable. This is not a movie for the Kim Kardashian audience. 

It's also a movie that instills some love for space exploration, adventure and overcoming adversity. It's obviously a little silly and the odds of success are marginal but it still works.

Ridley Scott has had quite a few misses through the past few years but I'm glad to say, The Martian is a returning form for the brilliant filmmaker.

3.5,"The Martian was all in all a good movie, although after reading the book, they cut out a lot of important events that transpired to Mark Watney  while on Mars.  When he is drilling the holes into the rover, in the book when he set down the drill he blew a fuse in Pthefinder and he loses communication with NASA, in the movie he never lost contact with NASA. This is important to the story line because it shows that not everything is going to go as planned on another planet. Second, on his trip to Schiaparelli Crater, in the book, there was a storm approaching and without the aid of NASA he had to figure it out on his own showing is ingenuity. In the movie, not even a single mention. Third, once he makes it to the crater, in the book, he did not simply just go down the side and get right to the MAV at Ares 4. He flipped the rover and they unhitched and he had to figure out a way to get them upright and continue his journey. To preface this last point, all of the other points I just mentioned they are important but not as important as this. Okay, so, when he takes off from Mars in the MAV and is travelling on the course to intercept with HERMES, the HERMES crew realizes that they are going to be moving too fast for  crew memeber Beck to jump out and retrieve him. The solution they come up with in the book, is to blow up part of the ship and release enough air for the HERMES to slow down and be able to send out crew member Beck to retrieve Watney. Perfectly reasonable and would work and end of story. Apparently, the director,  Ridely Scott, did not think that this would be good enough for the big screen. The writers and everybody involved in writing the movie do not think that this is good enough, so they decided to take a different approach. In the book Watney jokes around says that he will just unstrap and poke a hole in his glove and fly around like Iron Man. Now, we all know that would befun to do, but also very dangerous, and a lot of things could go wrong. But who cares  about all that in a movie right? That's exactly what the writing team must have thought when writing that movie. That was the ending, he cuts a hole in his glove and flew to Captain Johanssen, who did not go out and retrieve him in the book. The writing team just used a different ending, think about that, they just ended it differently. You cannot do that to people, like myself, who read the book and know the  true ending. Now there are millions of people around the world thinking that, that is how the book ended. This is just degrading to Andy Weir, the writer of the book, and everyone who actually read the novel. Why I am so angry about this is because, what if every book turned to movie had a different ending? What if Harry Potter did not defeat Voldemort in the Half Blood Prince Part 2? People would be calling for the head of whoever wrote this ending, because they spent their hard earned money and expect the same ending, and they actually get Voldemort taking over the world with the Dark Arts. Now, I realize that is a major exaggeration and taking it a little far, and also i  know these two movies are not nearly the same, but you get my point, movies cannot have different endings than the books that they are created from.",Zack K,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 05, 2015",Zack K,/user/id/971808561,RT,971808561,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206132999062938/picture,The Martian

Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, an astronaut who is left behind on Mars after being presumed dead by the rest of his team, now must use the powers of science to stay alive long enough for NASA to launch a rescue mission to save him. The thing that surprised me the most about this film was how funny and optimistic Mark Watney is. While most people in this situation would probably just give up and say it's hopeless, Mark instead says I am not going to die here, he is a determined survivor and always has a joke or wisecrack to brighten up the situation, his optimism and determination really makes us route for him, and makes us want to see him get rescued.",Drake S,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 05, 2015",Drake S,/user/id/967240477,RT,967240477,,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is smart, stylish and absurdly peppy and will definitely end up as one of my favourite movies this year. Matt Damon puts on a career-cementing performance as the stranded astronaut Mark Watney and a who's who of supporting actors work almost flawlessly off one another to bring high drama and high energy to this optimistic, fantastic science-fiction (emphasis on the science) romp. 

The Martian is also a great adaptation, one of the few that manage to rise above their source material. The original material most definitely makes for an engaging story but it reads like a book written by an engineer. The movie trims the fat and the technical diatribes as well as some of the more cringeworthy pop references and turns Watney into a fully fleshed character, who is still a peppy can-do guy but on whom the isolation and starvation start to leave their marks.

The visuals are absolutely fantastic and, although i'm not a fan, i have to say that this movie is definitely worth seeing in 3d. The cinematography in general is fantastic and the sound design doubly so, two definite specialties for director Ridley Scott who pulls another no-hitter after the disappointing Prometheus, Exodus, Robin Hood and the largely forgotten co-directed Counselor. The martian will definitely go into history alongside Alien, Blade Runner or Gladiator instead. There are a few tone deaf bits (Donald Glover's explanation of the Rich Purnell maneuver was cringeworthy, and Kristen Wiig in general was incredibly miscast, with Montrose coming across more as a confused sorority girl than the true spin-doctor the source material had her be) but they get a free pass in what is otherwise an enjoyable, emotional and positive movie that just might get a new generation excited about space exploration.

3.5,"This film is a superb visual spectacle with some truly breathtaking special effects. There is also a wealth of technical detail, especially relating to rescue operations for Mark 'The Martian' Watney. Presumably it is accurate (though I'm no scientist). As drama, however, and as a psychological study it's less convincing. I found it quite terrifying when Watney emerged confused from 
under ground, all alone on the planet Mars. But then he pulls a metal spike out of his abdomen, hardly shedding any blood, and proceeds to make himself at home on the space craft. It simply wasn't possible to suspend disbelief after that. He might almost as well have been relaxing in a luxury flat. It's very convenient as well that Watney is a botanist, 'the greatest botanist on the planet' as he amusingly remarks, and evidently gifted in other areas of science too. But he shows no real curiosity about life on Mars and, though Matt Damon's acting is engaging, virtually no emotion. Perhaps the film is fundamentally a tribute to The Power of Positive Thinking: Watney tells the people at NASA, with whom he easily establishes contact, 'I'm looking forward to not dying.' There might also be a political sub-text, as those chiefly responsible for rescue operations are black and Asian. It might be argued that the film is quite funny. Yes, but being stranded alone on Mars must be an unimaginably terrible ordeal.

4.0,"The Martian is an intelligent, well made and well acted movie. Everything about The Martian just falls into the right places. The humour, The science and the characters (although the role of team was not much strong). A comparison to either Interstellar or Gravity would be totally wrong. Since Interstellar was further and deeper in emotions, future and science as compared to The Martian which only deals with near future and every scientist's science. Gravity on the other hand had much similar substance ""Survival of a single protagonist"", but differed in aspects of visuals and the fact that we get to see only one character in space, where The Martian has alot of dramatized characters on screen.

4.5,"The reviews were right about this. I would very much compare this film to Cast Away. The film is all about Matt Damon and his struggle to survive on Mars. He has to deal with being on his own and trying to sustain food and water on a baron planet. 

Although at times the film will divert to the supporting cast (and most do a good job) the larger portion  of the film is set on Mars with Matt Damons character Mark keeping himself company. It's where the directors skill comes into play though. Both hilarious and heartbreaking, you really do feel for his character and that's a huge credit to Matt Damon. 

007 is going to receive most of the attention this month, but I would highly recommend this film to tide you over until then.",Darren E,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 05, 2015",Darren E,/user/id/827095057,RT,827095057,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1142021717/picture,The Martian
4.0,"Smart and fun, the movie is like Cast Away meets Interstellar, Gravity and Armageddon. Excellent acting from top to bottom, this cast was definitely stacked. The visuals were top notch and the 3D was pretty good. There was definitely an awe when you were watching the world of Mars. The movie was surprisingly funny. And this may also be the weakness of the movie. It was hard to see Matt Damon's struggles on Mars because of his ingenuity and lightheartedness. So when it comes to points when there is supposed to be some intense drama (first contact and climax rescue) I ""knew"" what Matt Damon was feeling in terms of relief and overwhelming emotions but I never really felt it. It is hard to root for an underdog when the dog is not really struggling and is actually having fun. The disco songs running jokes kinda got tiring eventually also. In the end the humor should also be the strength of the movie because that is what sets it apart from the other space movies out there.",Ramoncito R,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 05, 2015",Ramoncito R,/user/id/831928905,RT,831928905,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/840316357/picture,The Martian
4.0,"Ridley Scott is a great visual director. Everyone can agree from looking at his filmography, Aliens, Blade Runner, even Prometheus. This film opened similar to Aliens and Prometheus with the logo ""The Martian"" erupting out of pure silence. When I saw the trailer for this film months ago, I thought it was another Interstellar like film. Hell Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain is in another film about space travel, coincidence. 
Well the plot is about an astronaut who is stranded on Mars. The distance between Earth and Mars is four years. So how will Damon survive on a planet that lacks any resources. Will it just happens to be that Damon is a botanist. Damon's expiraments and how he survives on a desolate planet is great. Matt Damon is a very charismatic actor. He does a great job as an astronaut left behind. I like how his character keeps his cool as he spends his time on Mars. Damon is really great at portraying a character who is charismatic enough to play this situation off as a joke. Because he's smart enough to realize if he panics, he wouldn't survive.
This film has a sense of humor from all the great characters involved, Jeff Daniels, Chewetal Ejofor and all the other actors who play the NASA scientists back on earth. I felt that the scenes on earth had an Aaron Sorkin feel to the script. As those scenes show us a behind the scenes look at how NASA operates. The film does a great job at keeping these expositional scenes interesting and it doesn't feel like it goes over the head of someone who isn't a rocket science. The fast talking Aaron Sorkin like tone works in this film as the actors race to plan a rescue mission. I also like Scott's choice of using comedic actors in the film. Kristen Wiig and Donald Glover play employees for NASA. Glover does a great job at portraying the eccentric engineer.
This was a great entertaining film it has a quirky but not over the top humor that works. It's similar to Cast Away but on Mars.

4.0,"THE MARTIAN is based on the bestselling book of the same name written by Andy Weir. The book was brilliant! While the movie follows the book faithfully, the movie doesn't quite live up to the book in my view. I found the book more suspenseful than the movie. But the movie is still a very worthwhile outing! The characters are great with all of the cast giving excellent performances. Matt Damon, in the lead role as Mark Watney, stranded on Mars, brings his usual professionalism to the role and conveys the necessary humour in a what is a terrifying situation. However, THE MARTIAN needed to be more gritty and raw  for me - the whole thing seemed too nice and clean. The incredible stress, exhaustion and fear of being stranded alone on a planet conveyed in the book is not matched by the movie. The soundtrack is great, based on the favourite music of one of the mission astronauts left behind on Mars. There's a bit of a lag in the middle. One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is the focus on the use of science in solving the problems of survival in favour of sensationalism or over-the-top patriotism.

But it's a fun ride with a good sense of humour and amazing visuals. It's also Ridley Scott's best film in ages but it's not a classic like Blade Runner, Alien, etc. Matt Damon plays his every man role well as Mark, an astronaut stranded on Mars when his mission goes wrong and his crew assume he is dead. Survival tales are always welcome as I think it is great to witness humanity's ability to survive and prosper.

4.5,"The Martian is one of the best movies of the year and let me tell you why.

What Ridley Scott (Director), Drew Goddard (Screenwriter), Andy Weir (Book), and Matt Damon do with this movie is so unconventional and smile inducing, that it may redefine how some movies mix genres. I threw this under the category of Drama, but it wasn't a drama. I thought of possibly putting it under the comedy or thriller section, but The Martian is not a comedy or thriller nor is it just a mere mixture of genres to create a new Sci-Fi movie. So what am I trying to say? The Martian is a mixture of numerous elements that are authentically blended in a way that few movies can attest to. Consequently this makes it significantly harder to put a genre on it, but in this case, I think it's a good thing.

The Martian is straight forward in its plot. Mark Watney (Damon) is stranded on Mars during an emergency evacuation due to a massive storm. The other crew members (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie) think he is dead after they see him get struck by debris from the ship and so they are forced to leave him behind. Damon's character is then stuck with the seemingly impossible task to stay alive on Mars with limited resources and a 4 year time period until NASA's next mission to mars.

With a premise like this, you're most likely asking yourself, ""Why is the first line of my synopsis 'Hilarious'?"". The answer is found in the witty writing and amazingly charismatic performance of Matt Damon. Damon's character in the movie has a line in which he says ""I'm going to have to science the S--- out of this"". He must have looked at the script and said the same thing, only replacing science with charm. Watney is an overtly intriguing character even though there is virtually no background given to us about him. Weir and Goddard resist the cliche of giving him a family in order to heighten the stakes so that we care about Watney more (even though it would have been very easy and realistic to do). Instead, we rely on Damon's charm and delivery of the character to hold the stakes.

The Martian also did not go for outlandish Sci-Fi lore in the obvious far or near future or a super realistic drama with buzz kill characters. Instead it went for a superior inspiration of a slight detachment from present realism. The situation, the people, and the overall movie has an ideal outlook where the best is made of every hardship, and out of every character. You are aware that it is kind of outrageous and not completely in touch with what realistically would have happened, but in the end that's why The Martian is so great.  Damon may have had too good of a time on mars and because of this his dread may never have been completely realized. Executives of NASA and others are VERY selfless (not just in action but in actually caring for Watney) and use extreme measures and resources in the rescue attempt of Watney. However, in real life that may sadly be a bit far fetched. Maybe this is just what we need and are drawn to by the Martian though, watching people on screen see a massive need and doing all they can to relieve it.

The Martian is one of the best movies of the year, why? Matt Damon gives one of his most compelling performances and The Martian is a straight up good time while also intriguing to the mind. The film is also a great study on the nature of humanity and our desire to help one another.

5.0,"Just got back from seeing ""The Martian"" with my dear wife. We both thought it was outstanding! It's like 2 parts Apollo 13 and 1 part Castaway. Quick summary, in case you don't know, is that Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is left for dead on Mars and forced to survive alone.

Damon pulls off the role brilliantly, even though he spends most of the movie talking to himself and his video diary. The story is riveting and the science is believable. For sci-fi buffs, it's a no-brainer that you'll love it. For general space and science nerds, doubly so. They pack in tons of great scientific-based problem solving, but hinge the film on the nail-biting survival story of a man in the most inhospitable environment imaginable.

Full of twists and turns, the tension and excitement doesn't let up for a moment. In spite of that, there are also plenty of funny moments.

5.0,"Here's my quick review

The 3D effects were excellent. Not as good as ""Life of Pi,"" or ""Gatsby,"" but excellent.
The physics was WAY above par! Thy got the spaceship RIGHT! My initial fear, based on an early trailer, that they would have ""impossible"" gravity in the command module went gloriously unrealized. Movement from the central corridor of the ship (the Hermes) to the centripetal habitat access columns was beautiful.

Two minor concerns, though:

1) You have the front of the ship, then the big spin bearing, then the rotating habitat, the other big spin bearing, and then the tail of the ship. There is nothing else connecting the front of the ship to the rear of the ship. Theoretically, if your spin motors get out of sync, then the tail section slowly rotates out of phase with the front. Although (now that I think of it), you could have geared ""ring"" bearings, and a geared transfer shaft between them. OK, then. Never mind. Problem solved. NEXT!

2) When the astronauts transfer from the central spine to an access column, they ""magically"" float around the corner without touching anything. It's almost as if there's a strong flow of air from the central spine to the outer centrifuge. Almost as if it were a centrifugal fan. Which. I. Guess. It. Is. OK, then. Never mind again. And VERY cool.

When one of the astronauts on the OUTSIDE of the Hermes has to wend (I said wend) his way among the structs and structure of the rotating centrifugal (centripetal--yes, I know) structure, he takes great care NOT to get smacked by large rotating things. Maybe it's me, but he took just the right amount of care for my tastes...bravo.

Gravity on Mars is modeled at 1G (earth) gravity--I understand that concession. Just look at the way the dust kicks off the wheels of the (magnificent!) rover. But, if you ever find yourself wondering how Mark Watney can throw huge reclining chairs out of tall windows....Mars' gravity is really only about 38% of earth's gravity.

And you KNOW that a dust storm on Mars just isn't that bad The author (Andy Weir) conceded that--it was his one ""McGuffin""

Plus, no one in their right mind messes around with hydrazine like that, unless their life depended on it. Oh. Right. Never mind.

But, still....Matt Damon's performance was great. I felt ALL the performances were! The story was tight, and matched the book pretty well! And the ending--even though I thought it rang a bit false in the book--worked GREAT in the film!

4.5,"The Martian knew exactly what it was and didn't try to be anything else. It didn't take itself too serious and instead focused on entertaining the crowd while still holding self respect.

I really have no complaints about The Martian. The focus was almost always where it should've been. Every moment matters in this movie and there isn't one scene that seems to drag or hinder the movie in anyway. When we should be focused on Mark we are focused on Mark, when we should be focused on Earth we are focused on Earth. The Martian provided the perfect mix of drama and humor to give a personality to this movie that really anyone can enjoy. 

Matt Damon was excellent in this movie. He provided such a performance in this movie. He understood not only what his character showed on the outside but what his character was feeling on the inside. Just like Chris Pratt from Guardians in the Galaxy.

This movie didn't need any over the top gimmick. Even though it was a space movie set in the future this movie felt extremely realistic and it was almost refreshing. The audience didn't have to analyze this movie, they could just simply sit and enjoy the content being given to them.

1.0,"The movie was a disappointment. It was a project made to take a ride after Gravity (2013) and Interstellar (2014). First of all there is nothing in the movie that justifies the 3D feature. Secondly, the object models as hoover, spaceships, etc were filmed from distance, which made it look like 100% of the times amateur toys used to give the poor impression of reality. The director should have followed the Star Wars concept where the models were filmed in closed up. To move away from Gravity, there are lots of soundtracks that attempt to make the movie more human with less fiction science sounds. It was a poor choice in my opinion as there is nothing Earthly about going to Mars. And finally but not least, Saturday Night Live actress, Kristen Wiig is in the movie not even as a supporting role, as I believe she is trying to move away from comedy. However it was a terrible choice to include her in the movie as every time the camera showed her face, it gave me butterflies in the stomach waiting for her next scream and freaky face looks she uses in all her SNL sketches.

4.5,"Ridley Scott and Matt Damon have collaborated together for what could possibly be their best movie in a long time. The Martian has moments that will sweep you off your feet and put you right beside Matt Damon's character who is stranded on Mars. What I love most about this movie is the way his character has been conceived. He knows he is screwed but he chooses to remain positive and ends up being extremely humorous. At 3 different times during the course of the movie he refers to himself as a Mars-colonialist, a space- pirate and Iron Man respectively and this justifies the fact that the man is trying his level best to instill within him a certain amount of confidence which in turn could enable him to remain alive and wait for NASA to rescue him. When NASA realizes that Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is alive, chaos ensues and NASA's attempts to contact Watney had me in splits. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels have acted pretty well.

Jessica Chastain has and will always remain a good actress. At least I feel so. She plays an astronaut who feels guilty for having left Mark Watney on Mars during a fierce storm which had forced her and her colleagues to abandon the mission they were trying to accomplish. What's ironic is the fact that Ms. Chastain and Mr. Damon starred in Interstellar too. In that movie Damon had betrayed Chastain's father. In this movie Chastain is determined to rescue Damon from Mars. Ridley Scott has directed a movie which is not tremendously preachy, isn't overtly emotional and has doses of unexpected humour here and there. And it abounds in space technology that the protagonist dabbles with in order to survive. For all the above reasons this movie is going to be wildly successful. And when the movie finishes you will have your feet back on the ground with a THUD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Mitodru R,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 04, 2015",Mitodru R,/user/id/926534158,RT,926534158,,The Martian

5.0,"Oh it's so good to see Ridley Scott make a great movie again! But seriously, if I have to see another movie where Matt Damon needs to be saved I am going to  boycott every film Matt Damon makes, regardless of what his role in the film is. Aside from that, this movie is pretty much perfect. The casting is perfect, the performances are excellent, the score is incredible, the cinematography is gorgeous, the directing is perfect, the editing is perfect, and the script is brilliant! I laughed, I cried, I truly felt for these characters and feared for them too. I was on the edge of my seat and was never bored, and that's saying a lot for a nearly 3 hour film. The Martian is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect film and is definitely one of the best movies of the year. I highly recommend it. However, even though the 3D in this film was better than most 3D films, I still don't think this film needs to be seen in 3D. The 3D did not add anything to the fun or excitement or suspense this film had to offer. So, I would suggest not to waste your money watching it in 3D. But, if you are a fan of 3D and don't mind paying the extra money for it, then go for it, because like I said, the 3D is done very well. I just don't think the 3D was necessary for this film. Either way, go see The Martian asap, because it is one of those films that makes for a better viewing experience in the theaters than watching it on your T.V. at home.

5.0,"THE MARTIAN - okay everyone is going to compare this to Gravity and Interstellar. For me, what makes a great sci-fi movie is when a story takes a scientific concept... and successfully dramatizes it. Gravity took the concept of ""gravity"" and made us fear it. Interstellar took the concept of ""time dilation"" and broke our hearts. Now, The Martian takes the concept of ""botany"" and makes you respect it. Pretty badass, if you ask me. Plants are advanced life forms that can do organic chemistry -- little bastards that know how to convert sunlight into chemical energy. Allegorically, we see the main character Mark Watney do the same thing with solar panels and batteries to create energy. As he survives by growing crops that look full and plenty, so does he... but when his crops start to fail, we see Watney wither as well. Yesterday, I was on a hike in Palm Desert and saw a lone cactus in the middle of nowhere. It made me wonder how that single cactus got there. Apparently, plants can travel by animals eating plants and its seeds from one territory and taking a dump in another, and from its feces, a new plant arises. On a cosmic scale, this is similar to a theory called ""panspermia"" in which the seeds of life may have been transported to Earth on an asteroid... The greatest achievement in The Martian is making one wonder about soil on other planets. Is that an invitation for us to spread life? Anyway, I don't want to ruin any surprise plot points, but I believe there is a moral dilemma that is subtly hinted at, which is our place in the cosmos to tamper with another planet's ecosystem... at one point Mark Watney calls himself a Space Pirate, it may be a stretch to prove my film theory, but he knows that he's doing something illegal and does his best to GTFO of Mars.

4.0,"This movie is pretty great however I have a few slight issues. Matt Damon and the whole cast is great. The visuals are great. The overall story is good. 

For what I didn't like:
Seeing this in 3D wasn't mind blowing which is a disappointment. I'll quote Matt Damon's character in saying that disco music sucks. The scenes with Matt Damon alone on the planet was really emotional and inspiring and the scenes with the people back on earth take away from what the tone of this movie could have been throughout. Imagine this movie without seeing any other humans after Matt Damon gets left on Mars until he is finally rescued. I think that would have been a way more interesting movie. While Matt Damon is on Mars he has only one major disaster happen to him and I wish there could have been more obsticles to give a better sense of accomplishment. Lastly there was a few portions of the film where astronauts were willy nilly floating in space and the whole time I was upset considering what an awesome job the film Gravity did in letting us know that you can't float in space without fearing that something bad could happen.

Overall its a good film, I just would have liked more things done to make Matt Damon's performance better.",Ryan R,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 04, 2015",Ryan R,/user/id/872370163,RT,872370163,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000015405184/picture,The Martian
4.5,"""I am the best botanist on this planet"".

'The Martian' is something of a breathe of fresh air not just in the sci-fi world but in the current landscape of film. There's a low key feel to it and despite the situation our hero 'Mark' is in his upbeat attitude rarely ever wavers. The hard sci-fi category (which is IS in) is often full of heavy themes and warnings of Ai or environmental disasters that'll wipe everyone out.

Not 'The Martian'. Based on the 'Andy Weir' book of the same name 'The Martian' follows 'Mark Watney' (Mark Watney) after he's stranded alone on Mars when his crew thinks him dead. The story doesn't do anything that you wouldn't expect. The space fairing blockbusters have a familiar pattern and would never end on a sour note (even so those tense moments still hit). Not to mention the book itself is brilliantly upbeat from beginning to end. And for a film set on Mars there are surprisingly little special effects - aside from the space ship there's a beautifully created dust cloud at the beginning.

Even though the story follows a conventional pattern the way in which it unfolds is what makes it so captivating. Most of the film seen through the eyes of video logs, 'Mark' explaining his plans/ideas or to air his hatred of disco. Much the same as the book in fact as an adaptation it is nigh-on 100% accurate to the book. As well as Mark tackling with his harsh environment, there's also focus on the ground at NASA too. As they deal with the situation and release the new that they think he's dead - and when he's not the prepare for the media storm.

'Teddy', (Jeff Daniels), 'Mitch' (Sean Bean) and 'Venkat' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) scramble to get a rescue plan together while trying to deal with the pressure of essentially getting something ready in a fraction of the needed time. There's also the odd check-in with Mark's crew on their way back to earth. Unfortunately while they're both vital aspects they break up the flow of too much. As you can tell the real star is 'Damon' who's not getting the level of praise I think he deserves. He might be alone but he's full of funny quips and there's a good amount of genuinely interesting science. Boiled down so even the layman can understand the principals behind it - yep just like the book!.

There are more characters than it seems at first. With short stays (and I have to say my favourite character from the book 'Annie' (Kristen Wigg) is a little-short changed if you ask me) from 'Mindy' (Mackenzie Davis), 'Annie' and the straight shooting 'Rich' (Donald Glover). The writer 'Goddard' understands the book as well as anyone and doesn't mess with much at all and does a fantastic job of picking out what works best.

It's a nice positive based in reality sci-fi story and that's very rare. It's also very good, directed with Scott's usual respect and grounded eye he has towards Sci-fi. 'Damon' is brilliant as 'Watney' capturing his dry sense of humour and positive outlook no matter the situation. It's a testament to the story and strong central message that despite it's natural story beats and natural conclusion it's still thoroughly entertaining. This is one of Scott's best films ever and one of if not Damon's best performance.",Phil P,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 04, 2015",Phil P,/user/id/931017537,RT,931017537,,The Martian

4.0,"[8 outta 10] ~ IMO, The Martian ranks second to Gravity and is slightly better than Interstellar (only because the schmaltzy ""love"" angle drags Interstellar down) when comparing recent space movies. Can't help making comparisons between those three films despite being unique from one another either.

Matt Damon did more than just say ""Matt Damon!"" (ala South Park movie). He wasn't as good as Tom Hanks in Cast Away but still did a helluva job; The supporting cast was frickin excellent, because of them, non-Mars scenes were just as good as the Mars scenes, in fact, I kinda liked those scenes a little more than Mars scenes; Science was front and center in the movie (obviously) and did a good job making it not boring, hopefully it encourages kids to be more sciencey; Humour was an unexpected surprise; Good amount of plot twists; Very good directing from Ridley Scott (to make up for Prometheus, though I don't blame him for it, story/characters were to blame).

However... I found some of the soundtrack music didn't fit at times, don't get me wrong, the songs were irreplaceble classics but for some scenes they were too uplifting and not dramatic enough; The spacewalking and floating astronauts were too clunky, The Martian used old school actors-on-wires to float around when they should've went with the CG method used in Gravity; from what I've read, they cut a lot of stuff from the book, unfortunate but you could only put so much in a 2-3 hour movie.

2.5,"I saw The Martian last night. Serious writing issues around science exist in the movie. Also, too many nonsense references to music to break the monotony of the spoon fed science throughout the movie. He is the only human on the surface of Mars. He is in desperation and has his life in his hands on a daily basis. The references to pop music just does not fit to me. I prefer a great soundtrack with David Bowie or other bands but the use of this music is completely out of place.  The botany and the science to create a way to get more water are well done but now have been proven largely irrelevant in the face of recent news. They spoon feed relevant science until I was actually bored.  Seeing flowing water on the surface of Mars would have been amazing. Damon has some good moments on screen but it is frittered away with a lot of low tech filler with mounds of duct tape and plastic. They need to develop a little how this crew was selected out of all of humanity to go to a trillion dollar mission to Mars. The Captain and her guy are completely irrelevant to the film and low and behold at the helm do not look like they could handle the operation manual on an Apple product or a Caravan properly let alone captain a space ship to Mars. The secondary casting is all wrong. The ladies cast for this do not fit the part. They look more comfortable doing fitness or at a yoga retreat. It screams of gender tokenism. And, the Latino at the helm is just not intelligent enough to be in his position. This is all well and good but does not convince me they could be chosen for this crew. He would be alright in any OTHER position. The audience has to believe in them from minute one. They have to see brilliance in them in every step of the way. I did not see this.  By way of illustration, ""Gravity"" did not work for me because I did not believe for a minute Clooney or Bullock could be an astronaut in 1000 years of training.  I do not see anything unusually good in this movie other than amazing CGI and a few scenes Damon comes across with original acting struggles. The rating here is way, way too high. Furthermore, the landing on Mars is completely not there and should be. The landing is crucial. Period. Where is the science for this? I see science a lot in this movie but too much detail in the wrong places. In the forgotten movie The Red Planet, I thought the landing was fascinating and actually done well in an otherwise terrible movie where Val was stranded on Mars.  Mars deserves a better story and script. I prefer to watch a couple who hate each other on the way while  in relative comfort and safety travel to Mars all of sudden become violent lovers on Mars when all tech fails them. I mean the lady ties up Damon and whips him raw at his own choosing. Something that could realistically wile the hours away instead I see blanks in the years of time Damon has to wait. Too many question marks exist.  I prefer a couple fall in love on Mars than the banality of this Damon movie.  I was just able to watch the movie to the credits but I did not see a huge difference between this big feature film and the God awful one done called The Red Planet. The science being properly explained to get there was lacking and could have been written into the movie.

4.5,"The Martian is a modern homage to Apollo 13, an exciting blend of fiction and fact about bringing a brave man home. Watney is brought to life by Matt Damon, an optimistic, intelligent, likable hero. The other characters are a little flat although I found Mitch Henderson played by Sean Bean brought some much needed tension to the film. The only real problem with this film is the lack of screen time given to solving the problems of getting Watney home. This is where films like Apollo 13 and Gravity did a better job. A problem would be announced and solved. Things would break and be fixed. This probably worked better in the book when it was released chapter by chapter but the doesn't work as well on film. Otherwise this film is great! It portrayed many of the problems we will face as we explore outer space. The whole cast did a great job with the roles they had. You want to learn more about everyone in the film.

4.0,"Much better than Gravity, though not as good as Interstellar.

One of Scott's better movies. Kicks the pants off of Alien and kind of made up for the debacle that was Prometheus. (Seriously, how does the geologist get lost in the cave he --just-- mapped?) 

I admire that time travel or other wide-reaching pseudo-science wasn't used to aid Mark in his test of survival. The cinematography is fairly well done and the story makes steady progress. It does get a little difficult to get a sense of how much time has passed in the theatre if you're really invested in the story line. While the humor was welcome--and it was refreshing to see a major sci-fi movie that didn't take itself too seriously--it verged on the edge of too much. I kept getting the sense walking out of the theatre that just a joke or two could've been taken out and the tone of the film would've been preserved flawlessly. 

Not perfect though. The main reason I can't give it 10/10 is that it just feels like Matt Damon was added in to draw a larger audience. His performance was believable--for the most part. Though, a lesser name wouldn't have contracted from the essence of the film nor the book it was originally adapted from. Having him in there is just a way that Hollywood feels will draw in more 30 - 40 year old women. This sentiment feels insulting to the audience. Actors should be chosen not for their crowd appeal, but for how well they fit the part.

3.0,"3 out of 5 stars.  Liked it but didn't love it.  On a technical level, the film is very impressive with beautiful production design (the field director Ridley Scott came from, so always excellent in his films) to great cinematography & a strong central performance by Matt Damon, which keeps you involved in the story.

But the film is too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, for a setup you know where it's heading after 15 minutes.  ""Gravity"" was 90 minutes and kept you glued to every second.  ""The Martian"" is kind of Screenwriting 101 - get your character up a tree, throw rocks at him, get him out of the tree.  That's it, and no matter how much you dress it up, that's all there is to this film.

Great supporting cast mostly staring at a green screen panel alternately wincing, cheering or looking very worried.  Goes back to the days of ""Godzilla"" with Raymond Burr inserted, staring at a screen.

Damon's character mentions his parents, but we never see a life he left on Earth for a multi year mission.  The obvious comparison is to ""Gravity"" which only had three actors (one of them dead from the beginning) yet you felt Sandra Bullock's life on Earth so strongly, that it became imperative that she get home, even though you never saw that life, only felt it.

The science in ""The Martian"" is interesting, but some of the details at the end seem to stretch credibility.  Despite being a long film, the third act feels rushed - here's the decision, ten minutes later the action, after 2 detailed hours of his jerry rigging his own survival.  Great filmmaking here, but so-so script structurally (""now China's cooperating!"")  keeps this from being as good as expected.  Ridley Scott has made some of the greatest space films ever with ""Bladerunner"" and ""Alien,"" but the ""The Martian"" doesn't soar to the memorable heights those classic films do.  See ""Gravity"" instead for a recent example of true masterpiece in this genre.",Mark H,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Oct 04, 2015",Mark H,/user/id/851835142,RT,851835142,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/600393022/picture,The Martian

4.5,The Martian is a great film about a man stranded on Mars played perfectly by Matt Damon. Think Cast Away meets Apollo 13. The visuals are spectacular and tension is extreme.

The difference in this environment as opposed to just open space is that it allows for more calm moments, giving chance to the audience to catch their breath between each scene of intensity.

4.0,"So, a lot of the nominated this year are being criticized/called out for a lot of them being ""a white man faces adversity"" movies. And this one is no different. This is not only a white man facing adversity movie, this is a also a survivalist movie, in a year that already has The Revenant. And it is really hard to not notice the similarities. Hell, even the posters look similar. But, what makes this one stand apart is how undeniably human it is. Most survivalist movies show our main character gritting his teeth, self fixing an injury, eating some raw bison meat, and toughing it out. Instead, we see a man who while he does grit his teeth and yank an antenna out of his side, and eat some dehydrated space food, he also get upset, gets his hopes lifted, gets angry, and even laughs. This is thanks to a wonderful performance form Matt Damon. I think this may be a personal favorite for me. The rest of the all star cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Kristen Wiig, and Donald Glover (to name a few) only makes this even better. I actually would have loved to see Chiwetel Ejiofor get nominated for supporting actor, I thought he was great.  My only complaint was that while there were some moments of peril, I never actually believed that he was going to die. And apparently the original book has him almost die multiple times? Maybe at least one of those was needed to amp up the stakes, instead of a dude chilling on Mars for like a year and a half.

5.0,"""The Martian"" es una película que nos presenta un escenario puramente de supervivencia, por supuesto con drama, pero también lo hace de manera inteligente, emocionante e incluso hasta divertida.  Es muy superior a Interestelar de Nolan y esta casi a la par con Gravity de Cuarón, quizá lo único que hace la diferencia es que The Martian viene de la adaptación de un libro publicado en 2011, pero vamos,  la actuación de Matt Damon es impresionante y la dirección de Ridley Scott impecable.

5.0,"""The Martian"".. a ridiculously awesome movie by Ridley Scott. Alfonso Cuaron made you feel that you are stranded in space with movie ""Gravity"", Chris Nolan made you feel that you are on a altogether different planet with ""Interstellar"" but Ridley Scott managed to do both the things in a single movie.
The movie is two hours of sheer fun, excitement, surprises and light moments which will make you chuckle, clap or sometime go dead quite that you wouldn't even want to take a bite of popcorn.
Matt Demon pulled of a brilliant astronaut. But special kudos to Ridley Scott for keeping it interesting and surprisingly simple (we all saw interstellar right. And all claim that we understood the movie. :D)

3.5,"The Martian is an unabashed crowd pleaser. Once Matt Damon realizes he's been abandoned by his flight crew, he remains a spirited protagonist. He plows ahead with a plucky abandon determined to make a go of the hand he has been dealt. ""I'm going to have to science the sh- out of this"" is his oft repeated quote. He relies on a combination of duct tape and disco. Ok so that's not all, but the cheesy music selections give the drama an air of ridiculousness. They even inform the story. From Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn the Beat Around"" to Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" - what the timeworn ditties lack in originality, they make up for in listenability. Try not and smile as he transports a radioactive isotope while grooving to Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"". I'd be rolling my eyes if it weren't so gosh darn funny. ""Bring Him Home"" is the tagline on the poster. That's the objective and everyone gets involved - from China, who must declassify their own space program, to an aerodynamics geek at NASA that comes up with a solution. The latter's use of a stapler to dumb down his explanation for his superiors, is amusing for his condescending tone. The whole world is captivated by Mark Watney's predicament. The Martian is simplistic in plot, but elaborate in experience. Breezy Hollywood hokum makes you feel good to be human. Sunny optimism never felt so cerebral.

1.0,"I'm not trying to be the reviewer that sees a well rated film and decides to go against everyone's opinion just to be controversial, but my girlfriend and I saw this movie last night and were horribly bummed about this movie. 

We both read the book and were really looking forward to the film. we saw the 3D version last night and actually decided to walk out. Again, we are not trying to just lambaste a movie because it was rated well, but this movie was bad. I saw some reviews of if saying it was Ridley Scott's greatest film in a while and I have no clue where that comes from. 

Again, we both read the book, loved the story and were checking out the trailers. We both were so excited they cast Matt Damon and thought their trailers were great as well, especially one featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson. But the whole film was such a big disappointment, not only to this story but also as a representation of good film making and story telling. 

You're not going to believe me but I will say this a third time, I am absolutely not trying to hate on a well liked movie for the sake of hating on it, and I'm glad people liked it. I just have zero clue why. My experience of it was that it felt like a story that skimmed so quickly over everything to the degree that I didn't care about the main character (and we both thought Matt Damon was a perfect casting choice for Mark) and I didn't think the story had any stakes. 

It's like in five minutes, Mark was stranded, declared dead, found to be alive, then reached the lander. For my GF and I, we couldn't believe it. He was already at the lander? Where the hell was the drama behind him being declared dead and the turbulence that would cause NASA to have in discovering he was alive? This whole film was a terrible representation of a great story and book. I don't know if they just edited out much of what Ridley Scott filmed and that is why it went from him being declared dead to suddenly alive and communicating with earth like it was not a big struggle at all, but my GF and I both decided to walk out at the same time. 

That is a big deal for me, walking out of a movie. I paid to see the 3D version of it which was expensive, but usually I don't ever think a film is that bad to merit that action. To prove it to you, the last film I walked out of was the movie with Steve Martin and Queen Latifa back, like over ten years ago.

2.0,"No!  Ridley Scott wasted a wonderful opportunity to bring the audience into the isolated and desperate dilemma of the main character.  But, instead, he just walked us through easily-solved non-disasters one after another.  There was practically no emotion expressed by any characters . . . so how was the audience supposed to feel anything?  The fascinating element of the novel was Mark Watney's resilience, knowledge, and cunning.  The director chose to  tell us how he was all of those things . . . not let him show it to us.   

The soundtrack was also a misguided effort.  The original score was oddly used and added no tension or feeling at all . . . or, it took you out of the moment.   It seemed like a throwback to 70s sci-fi soundtracks.   The use of disco, while thematically appropriate, was mis-used and over-used.  Disco is too up-beat for a thriller/adventure like this.  It should have been used as a contrast to his situation, but, it's application worked against that effort.

4.0,"IN SPACE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU FARM - My Review of THE MARTIAN (4 Stars)

Don't let the song title from LES MISERABLES in the poster art fool you, THE MARTIAN is not Tom Hooper's latest terrible movie.  There's nary a fisheye lens or distracting live singing to be found in this emotionally surprising, thrilling new film from Director Ridley Scott and Writer Drew Goddard (WORLD WAR Z, CLOVERFIELD).  Unless you've been living on another planet (insert yuks here), then you know by now that this is the story of Mark Watney (Matt Damon), an astronaut left for dead on Mars who has to figure out how to survive.  Part rescue mission and part DIY Instructional, the film returns Scott to sci-fi in much better form than his previous outing, PROMETHEUS.  Instead of Little Green Men, we get Little Green Pods as Damon terra farms the Red Planet.  It's way more exciting and engaging than that sounds.  

When a freak accident forces his crew, led by a commanding, sharp Jessica Chastain, who shines here, to abandon him, Damon slowly but surely finds his feet.  This section of the film is a science nerd's dream come true, yet the humor and Damon's performance keep the minutiae fresh.  Similar in structure to GRAVITY but taking place over a much longer span of time, THE MARTIAN is a tribute to perseverance and smarts, the latter often lacking in big studio movies these days.  Preventing this from being CASTAWAY IN SPACE is a large cast of characters either back on Earth at NASA or on board his rescue ship.  We're treated to such names as Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Donald Glover, HALT AND CATCH FIRE'S Makenzie Davis (brought into the future but still behind a computer!), and Kristen Wiig, who surely had a larger part because she mostly just stands around looking worried.  

THE MARTIAN isn't without its flaws.  Its epic length suggests a higher body count than what we're given here and the wall-to-wall pop songs, while hilariously entertaining throughout, remove the lurking sense of danger at times...and yet, I wouldn't want it any other way.  These ""problems"" allow the film to stand on its own instead of blending in with the usual sci-fi grandeur we've experienced.  This lack of pomposity provides a clearer view of its characters quirks and emotions.  When the tears come, and they do, you may find yourself feeling it more because of the humanistic approach.  A minor quibble comes with an insert shot of an ABBA'S GREATEST HITS album cover.  Unless you're steeped in ABBA lore like me, you may miss it, which takes away from a latter payoff.  I told you it was minor!

Technically, the movie is flawless.  Veteran cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and Production Designer Arthur Max return us to the grimy, lived-in detail of ALIEN, with its swirling debris in the first act and realistic views of another planet.  This makes up for their too-sleek work on PROMETHEUS.  Editor Pietro Scalia understands how to make sense out of the many moving parts so that you always know where you are in a scene.  

Oftentimes, space films suffer from a lack of relatable moments.  It's hard to care when you have no idea what knobs to push on a space ship.  Anyone who has ever had a job where everything always goes wrong, however, can relate to this movie.  It's a tribute to the entire cast and crew, that THE MARTIAN buckles down and simply goes to work at problem solving.  Damon isn't always the warmest of screen actors.  He's more often than not a tough little spark plug, and while that's mostly true here, he builds such wonderful rapport with his space comrades, despite barely ever sharing a frame with them.  The script takes the time to provide little character moments, such as when Ejiofor and Mackenzie debate the tone of one of Damon's emails.  This film may be epic in scale, but it turns out to be small in all the right ways, allowing THE MARTIAN to soar.",Glenn G,False,True,False,False,4.0,"Oct 04, 2015",Glenn G,/user/id/799709308,RT,799709308,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/720603734/picture,The Martian

How refreshing it is then, to see The Martian land in terrestial cinemas armed with awe inspiring visuals and great story anchored by a stellar cast.

2.5,"Watched the movie demanded more then what was delivered. Just because I happened to watch Matt Damon in ""The Departed"" few days earlier. 

The Martian , just seemed a bit unrealistic to me , you are stuck on mars and you don't have fever or fear. You have no emotions specially since you are also injured.

The movie lacked the dark thoughts of dying. Was it intentional to elect Dumb and Dumber actor as Director or NASA was that a subliminal message being sent to the audience?  Movie lacked fear of dying

Majority of time I was just enjoying the 3D view of Martian landscape I was less worried about the live of the Astronaut. I will say the movie was a visual master piece.

The movie lacked the hallucination factor , of a man living on his own for solitary confinement. This was better captured in Tom Hank's Cast Away. The movie made it too easy for human imagination to accept the fact that one can enjoy a potato for more then 3-4 days in row.

The movie lacked , projecting emotions of man desiring to see the ocean , or the birds flying or the man walking in a garden on earth suddenly seeing the horizon change into martian landscape. Or what about the man wondering about his life on earth or his relations being effected by the stranded nature of affairs.

And how dumb was the scientist that came up with the sling theory for the rescue mission. Oh wait I forgot , dumb and dumber guy was the Director in chief. Or the Director of Operations  Absolutely no emotions what so ever. I mean the sling theory was all he came up with which most people have known since Apollo movie Hollywood made there was nothing new there.

The movie really loses it when it declares that NASA could not replicate their Rocket launches in under 30 days with all the technology they have since 60's when Moon launches were done.
 
All they had to do was launch a ""Supply"" rocket not even a advance lander. We are talking about the most industrial nation on world can't make a simple supply rocket. Design a new Rockey is hard , sending a copy of existing technology is pretty easy stuff.

Any why did the astronaut did not venture into Martian Caves for a possible living space 

Looking back , it made no sense what so ever that the Director of NASA would not request visual confirmation of death for the astronaut or seek cameras to be active on the region.

It just felt like the Director of the movie was just trying his best to get the movie moved into space so they could proceed and make a mini ""Gravity"" movie. A movie that tried to focus on the linking of modules and space capsules together.

Speaking of gravity , the movie did not even mention the effect of gravity on the astronaut's life of effects of lack of gravity on Mars.

The movie fails to capture the pressure , the Martian's family back home puts on NASA via media. It felt like Martian was an orphan

I don't know it just looked so reckless , and so childish when the Astronauts returning home decide to return back 570 something days to give ride to the missing person. That does not happens in real life , if you miss your boat people do not change course to pick a hitchhiker.

Cast away , captured more of Humanity then Martian did , in Cast away you knew the man wanted to be with his love of his life , there was human nature playing its part desire to be with someone a greater goal a purpose. However martian was just more interested in having a blast on the martian base music , dancing and growing potatoes. 

I wish they just let us hear the martian atmosphere ... or sound of mars as the martian sat outside the mountains gazing into martian soil just 2 minutes of viewing the landscape and martian sounds.

For some reason I kept imaging Loyd  , with Mrs Samsonite's bag , to knock on Martian's base and tell martian ""Man , you are on pathetic looser"", after all he had supplies of for 6 people and yet he could not ration his food.

And PS Vincent Kapoor = Black dude , I suppose they were short on actors lots of brown actors from Bollywood if you need one

4.0,"Exciting adaptation of the now classic book that doesn't quite live up to it's brilliance but managing one of the most entertaining science fiction films in recent years.  Matt Damon is superb as Mark Watney, giving the performance of his career as you instantly like & root for him while believing he can survive alone on Mars, despite the odds.   The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with each given nice moments and like the book, there are no bad guys.  Everyone is out to save Watney and the only conflict is how to do it.  Behind the camera, Ridley Scott wisely sticks close to the book, condensing most of it smartly (he doesn't need to go into as much detail with the science as the book did) and it keeping it moving briskly, despite being over 2 hours.  However, some changes don't quite work as the best joke in the book's punchline is changed, resulting in less laughs, and the ending doesn't quite the have the same punch.

4.0,"One small step for moviegoers, one Giant Leap for NASA. The Martian lives up to all the hype. Special effects only matched by predecessors....Interstellar, Star Trek (Into Darkness), and Gravity.

Ok so it is a lot like space's version of Castaway without Wilson. Instead of a bloody volleyball Matt Damon effectively uses Computers and Satellite communication devices to verbalize his thinking and actions to the audience. You are captivated when the movie starts and it never lets your heart stop. 

Supporting cast members like Vincent (played flawlessly by Chiwetelu Ejiofor), Yang Haiwen (Flight Director), and Daniel Glover (from TV's Community) as the funny astrophysicist all combined to elevate the sometimes predictable plot into something really good and amusing.

Matt Damon's character Mark whatney carries the movie from the lead actor position. The long list of other A-List actors were less than great, with the exception of Michael Pena (aka Martinez). The rest were plug and play characters. Jessica Chastain (Lead actress??) and Jeff Daniels (as NASA Director) were underwhelming. Daniels performance was 10 times better in ""Dumb and Dumber To"". Chastain tried to channell her best Dallas Bryce Howard impersonation (Jurrasic Park, The Help...much better actress) The supporting cast were a better focus on this movie and ultimately pulled it through. 

There was the overdone ""Rah Rah hip hooray America,"" and ""We are the World"" parts that worked well enough to make you feel like you really might like your compatriots and that we can come together as a world. (I did like the Republic of China's tie into the plot).

Okay maybe not an awe inspiring review of a really good flick. The reason I gave this Sci-Fi semi-epic cinematic creation four stars is because of Director /Creator Ridley Scott. His overall vision and directing was as astounding as the likes of Stanley Kubrick (2001 A Space Odessey), Speilberg, George Lucas, Gene Roddenberry, and JJ Abrams. These space genre icons boldly go where no-one has gone before. This time taking us on a transcending journey to Mars and some of might get back (no spoilers). This movie unanimously answers that age old question, What would life be like on Mars...

propulsion of The Martian into interplanetary heights was Ridley Scott's emphasis on lesser known scientific explanations from truly believable scientists and personnel running Houston Operation command center and simultaneous simulations performed at other sites in other states to show how many interactive cogs have to funtion together for a federally funded mission to succeed. The use of ike machinery on Earth to help simulate mars rovers holding hands with the lame person to an almost understanding of the feasabilty/risk analysis and stressful decisions and critical steps a project manager takes are examples of what turns my crank and highly stimulates the business/geek brain sections of me...How many times to directors make us take leaps of faith on their implausible unexplained outcomes in these type of movies?

A good director will provide the detailed minutia and make you glad they did. And you don't realize it's 3 hours long. These scenes were some of best of the movie. I reminisce of similar Armageddon and Apollo 13 scenes

Kristen Wiig. (who I've grown to admire from Ron Burgundy 2 and Walter Mitty) ...acted like she showed up late for an SNL skit and was being fed lines from offstage. And another fav Kate Mara (house of cards) Sean Bean via Lord of the rings and a shout out to his LOTR buddies) provided nothing more than familiar faces lacking enough quality lines of script to even care...not a financially prudent move by 20th Century. The Martian producers could have used No-Name actors auditioned from talent agencies they would been much more intruiging. An opportunity to launch a star instead of relying on side movie references to what was. Where's the English Teacher I never had when I might need 'em ð~?

My LG 2 phone question mark (?) Key was not damaged while writing this review. 

I love these movies, even cynical references to Pirates pushes the button that rings my bells and buzzers.

3.5,"Space epics haven't been this much fun and satisfying in ages. That's the miracle of The Martian. Director Ridley Scott once again rediscovers the fire he's lost recently in misfires such as Robin Hood, Prometheus, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings. Scott's film version of Andy Weir's best-selling novel is firing on all cylinders, fueled by a delightfully entertaining and heroic performance from star Matt Damon. It's not cosmic philosophy or a thinkpiece like Interstellar (featuring Damon in a malevolent cameo) or 2001: A Space Odyssey, and there are no scary monsters bursting forth from anyone's chest like Scott's classic Alien, but The Martian puts right up close and personal with Damon's plight. With a you-are-there script from Drew Goddard, The Martian doesn't wallow in doomsday scenarios in all of its bracing, exciting 142 minutes. This survival tales arrives with plenty of suspense and intimacy, and will leave you leaving the multiplex feeling good.

'I'm pretty much fucked' are the first words that come out of the mouth of the newly stranded Mark Watney (Damon). After only 18 sols (a full day on Mars), this NASA botanist has been left for dead by his crew, including Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie and Sebastian Stan, all under the command of a no-nonsense Jessica Chastain. They all believed in perished in a freak dust-storm. So the mission is aborted and they head back home, where Watney is pronounced dead and mourned as a martyr.

That's where the complications come in. Satellite photos reveal that Mark is in fact alive, relying on his botanist wits to survive. He even manages to grow potatoes using the crew's manure as fertilizer. But how will he get home and stay alive for the four years it will take to land a rescue mission (he has only enough food to last a month)? No need to do the math since that's what Jeff Daniels is for as NASA's director, aided by a Mars expert (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the harried PR manager (Kristen Wiig, wonderful). As they sweat out a solution, Watney's crew, still in transit back to Earth, consider risking their lives to rescue Watney themselves. It all serves as excellent propaganda for the space program, and makes for a killer good movie.

A little too earnest? Perhaps, but The Martian is one hell of a ride. Kudos to Scott, his FX team and the amazing work of cinematographer Darius Wolski, shooting in Jordan to stand in for Mars. A nice touch too having the distraction-starved Mark have to rely on a collection of disco hits to entertain himself. Isolated on a deserted planet for nearly two years with only an occasional 'Fuck you, Mars' to vent his frustration, Watney comes close to cracking. Luckily Damon is an actor of uncanny skill and magnetism, a real movie star, and keeps you glued to your seat. You're with him to the end.",Manny C,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 03, 2015",Manny C,/user/id/783684766,RT,783684766,,The Martian
3.0,"3.25/5* or 6.5/10

Okay I am going to be in the very small majority that didn't love Martian, and believe me after reading the rave reviews etc, I really tried to love it but maybe it  the sky high exceptions, made the film a okay/good watch at best .My theory for not loving the film is exactly what Matt Damon's character says in the film ""we got to science the shit out of this"", meaning for me the film had too much science, numbers, etc, I didn't find that kind of stuff that interesting this time around in Martian, but its surprising because, I thought Interstellar was amazing, maybe that was the Nolan affect, I don't know. But the film was still fairly good in my eyes, because,just think how hard it would be to be survive on earth if you very left with almost nothing and stranded on a deserted island.Now forget about earth, and think about the same conditions but on mars. Yeah its like a million times worst. So Martain does make for an endearing story, and the VFX in the film is simply amazing. The films starcast is also something to marvel over with the likes of Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain,Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. But as I stated above I had problems with the film that muddled my experience, but more on that later.

Story wise the film is about NASA astronaut Mark Watney, and how after a storm hit Mars, his  team has to leave back for earth, but Mark gets hit by a metal object in the wind strom, and is left on Mars, after his team thinks he is dead. Mark however survives, and soon  figures out through the help of his botany expertise how to survive on Mars for a long time. Soon NASA realizes that Mark has survived also, and they try in which ever way to help Mark, but it will take atleast 400 days before they can send someone back to Mars to get him back home.The rest of the story is about if Mark can survive on Mars, and make it back to earth safely.

Acting wise the whole ensemble was pitch perfect. Matt Damon leads the way in one of his career best roles, his character is very endearing, and one feels like routing for him. Jeff Daniels has become the every so dependable actor and proves it again in this film. Chiwetel Ejofor is great, and his reaction in the rescue mission is priceless. Out all the NASA team members Jessica Chastain gets the meatiest role and is good.

See I believe and this is just my opinion so beware, that if your not into science or a science geek at many junctures your going to be left dis interested while watching Martain. The film gets too much into the nitty gritty science facts numbers etc , and at times it feels like the film is not moving or nothing interesting is happening. For example you felt bad for Damon's character, and when he grew crops etc you were amazed but after a point you feel as Damon's character has adjusted to Mars and has no desperation. Also a lot things happen in the film really easily like when Mark finds the camera etc.The film has so much dialogue at one point you feel like the film is moving at snails pace,the film definitely needs a shorter length. But Martain also has many amazing features. Like the VFX for example is outstanding, Mars, and space never seemed so real, and beautiful. The films beginning, and especially climax are great, and the whole Damon, and Chastain scene in the climax will get your heart pounding. There are many scenes that evoke some laugher, and many scenes where you feel like clapping when Mark comes through with a break through on mars. And films is very detailed in all its research, the films crew definitely did its homework.

Overall all negatives withstanding, watch Martian because one can see the kind of  ambition that went into this Ridely Scott directorial, and there are enough good things in the film like the VFX, acting, climax etc to warrant one viewing, just don't go in the cinema hall with huge expectations.

2.5,"(Some spoilers - read at your own risk) 

It was with great anticipation after the haunting and excellent Prometheus that I went to see The Martian.

Unfortunately it was disappointing on many levels. 

I will give a few tips of the hat. The visual effects are stunning. The surface of planet Mars was beautifully rendered as were all of the Rockets / space stations / and technical equipment which were very believable. 

Matt Damon delivers a solid performance as does Jessica Chastain. And the premise is an interesting one. But it's a vision not fully realized. 

Here are the things that went wrong in my opinion. 

1) Casting and characters. Damon and Chastain are the ONLY believable characters. The rest of the astronauts came across as juvenile. Even Damon's character bordered on clownish but that wasn't his fault, it was the writing and directing. Every other character was disposable. Kristen Wiig? Please. Jeff Daniels. Come on. I would've much rather seen lesser known character actors give those parts more depth. 

2) The writing seemed geared towards the lowest common denominator. At times it was like watching Transformers. Dumb jokes and misplaced sarcasm didn't fit the intensity of the situation these characters were in.

3) The music. The use of cloying disco tunes was overdone. It could be funny once or twice but here became tiresome. The rest of the score was also off. Scenes that could have been more dramatic fell flat. A good score goes a long way in creating climactic moments - this one was lacking.  

4) Overall. Not once was I moved deeply. Not once did I feel a great truth was revealed. Instead it all felt like a canned film made to make money. And what was with the Chinese coming in to save the day? Awful. Just too pandering and easy.

4.0,"Many are calling ""The Martian"" Ridley Scott's return to form. I think this is ridiculous, as I hold the minority belief that his recent work has been of high quality. Nevertheless, ""The Martian"" is Scott's best film in years. One of the largest criticisms of Sir Ridley's films is their often overly dour nature. I find such a criticism reasonable as hardly any of the Englishman's films contain even an ounce of humor. I never thought this would change since Scott, now 77, is a fairly old man. They say old people are set in their ways, but in Scott's case, that clearly isn't true. Scott, notorious for his ever grumpy demeanor, reinvents himself with ""The Martian"". It is a film that shockingly contains just as much, if not more, humor as drama. And all of the humor works; the way this film manages to balance its frequently shifting tones is rather remarkable. 
Ultimately, ""The Martian"" serves as both a reaffirmation of Ridley Scott's brilliance, as well as a refreshing rebuttal to the more serious astronaut films (such as Gravity and Interstellar) that have been released in recent years. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention Matt Damon. His performance is fantastic; it might actually be the best of his career.",Andrew W,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Andrew W,/user/id/890630178,RT,890630178,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000203571591/picture,The Martian

3.5,"This is a good movie.  It's very solid science-drama.  What it's not is ""thrilling,"" which surprised me since all I'd heard about it going in was how ""thrilling"" it is.  It's not.  It's largely Matt Damon struggling to grow potatoes and doing math.  That's not to say that it doesn't have a good story and a few thrilling scenes, but it's not the non-stop thriller that GRAVITY is, which is more or less what I was expecting going into it.  It also fails to really make you connect to the characters on an emotional level.  Damon's character is really good at his job, and really good under pressure.  He takes his situation in stride, which makes perfect sense in-context (he's exactly the kind of guy you'd sent to Mars), but, unfortunately, doesn't make for good drama.  For a movie about a guy in a situation where the only obvious outcome is a slow and painful death, I never once felt afraid, or even sorry for him.  He seems almost okay with it most of the time, which means we, the audience are pretty much okay with it, too.  This is in stark contrast to Sandra Bullock's character in GRAVITY, who constantly seems on the edge of sheer panic the whole way through, which helps sell the desperation of the situation, and where Ryan Stone's homecoming was triumphant and heartfelt, Mark Watney's homecoming felt so assured that it's almost hard to care.  Both characters use ingenuity and science to beat the odds and survive, but only one of them ever seems to be in any real danger of failure.  The other seem mildly inconvenienced, at best.

Still, it's a well-made movie and very enjoyable to watch.  It makes me think that the book is probably a lot more gripping.

4.5,"Ridley Scott returns with ""The Martian"" after a decade of 'quality film' hiatus. This adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name is refreshing to all movie goers. The picture looks stunningly beautiful. Beautifully shot and visually flawless , it holds the illusion for the entire length. Mars never looked more beautiful and desolate. With that setting , there is a beautiful castaway story. The script is properly structured . It is nicely setup , scenes are nicely interplayed and even though the movie is played out across various locations  the writing makes it feel as one coherent piece .  This is one of the first blockbuster movies that truly makes it feel international . The smart editing between different countries and the space for a singular moment makes it feel tight resulting is gripping moments throughout the movie . Scott makes a fine job of utilizing every single frame in telling the story . The picture never dragged - it is nicely paced. Some of the sequences are immensely gripping , others funny. The cynical humor is present throughout the scenes and Matt Damon delivers a tremendous performance. His whole array of acting skills are expressed. I must say this one of Damon's best performances . The movie has a lot of pop-fiction references so fans might find it great.  Overall this a tense , gripping and a fun movie that all should enjoy.

I didn't know whether or not Scott could deliver. Last month we had a similar dilemma with M. Night Shyamalan and The Visit. Shyamalan hadn't been doing well for a while, and The Visit looked to be his redemption. And while Shyamalan failed at making his return, Scott has succeeded with The Martian. This hails the return of Ridley Scott. He directs this film masterfully, introducing a steady pace and a fluidity to the movie. Matt Damon is fantastic as Mark Watney, bringing a range of emotions to the character.

He had the perfect demeanor for the role, the supporting cast was also well selected and didn't let down.  but the film belongs to Damon.  now I will say, the film left out some parts I thought reading the book would be more important and at 2 hours and 22 minutes, you'd think they'd just go all out.

2.5,"Matt Damon promised us all in the theatric preview (and early in the movie itself) that he was going to ""science the shit outta this (his conundrum)."" 

Unfortunately, the filmmakers Hollywood and bureaucrat the shit outta the rest of the movie, to the point that it just sort of drones on ad nauseam. Case in point: We get to watch as the Martian types out his messages back to Earth which he then narrates for us before the screen cuts to the receiving screen on Earth so we can watch the message appear, word-by-word, on that screen...before cutting to the Earthling who then narrates...again...the message to us - just in case we didn't get the message the first two times we read it or heard its original narration.

Ugh. Seriously. This happens.

The problem here is that, for a Science Fiction film that purportedly has been scienced the shit outta, there's just too little science and too much, well, shit.

It's too bad the screenwriters and editors just didn't edit the shit outta this.

P.S. I didn't stick around for the closing credits, but I'm betting there was a huge ""Thank You"" to Lowe's for the supply of plastic tarps, bungee cords and duct tape so they could make sure their sciencing the shit outta the movie looked authentic. 

P.P.S. Ugh. Seriously. The Martian is saved by plastic tarps, bungee cords and duct tape. Red Green would be so proud.

5.0,"Just when you thought all the thrills of summer blockbusters came and went (since we've already headed to Fall, if you can believe it), along comes director Ridley Scott's latest film, The Martian. This Matt Damon vehicle is by far the best popcorn flick of the year, and it's hard to believe this was released in the fall. It is the most exciting film I've seen in a while.

We begin the film with a crew of NASA astronauts just about to finish their very first mission on the planet Mars. However, during a terrible sandstorm, an astronaut named Mark Watney (Damon) is seriously injured after being hit by a piece of debris, and is left behind after he is presumed dead by his crew. We later find out that he is still alive, and has been trying to figure out a way to grow crops such as potatoes on a planet that isn't Earth. Luckily, when NASA finds out that Watney is indeed alive and is still on Mars, NASA tries to find a way to bring him back home to Earth. This pollen definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, and you could definitely feel the suspense of every moment these NASA employees experience. The performances were top-notch, especially Matt Damon's performance as the protagonist Mark Watney. Most of the crew including Jessica Chasten as the commander and Michael Peña as Rick Martinez did fantastic in their roles in the film. However, the biggest showstopper of them all in my opinion was Jeff Daniels playing the role of NASA director Teddy Sanders. When he notices that Watney is still alive, we find out how nervous he is about accusations of a coverup might be exposed, and it's his mission to take Watney home safely in order to avoid a potential scandal.

This film definitely knows how to build suspense among its audience, knows how to bring thrills to the moviegoer, and knows how to have a good sense of humor in order to make an otherwise serious movie such as this not depressing. If you're looking for a good weekend escape from all the stress from school, college, or work, and if you're looking for a great cinematic experience on top of it, I totally recommend Ridley Scott's The Martian.",Matt N,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Matt N,/user/id/919372183,RT,919372183,,The Martian

Everyone from the captain who leaves Watney on Mars to the director of NASA bring an immediacy and tumbling along pacing to the disaster after cataclysm to a human in a hugely hostile environment.

I was really surprised by how goofy this movie was. It was trying so hard to be funny and many of the jokes got laughs but many of them got crickets. Really forced humor. The super light tone made it really hard for me to take the rest very seriously. Life-endangering situations didn't have any weight. Until the end. And even that was handled with jokes galore and images to go with it. I was hoping for more of a thrill ride with tense moments and some profound philosophical points. Instead I got amateur comedy sprinkled over an otherwise decent story with no punch at all. I'm disappointed with how shallow it was.

4.0,"The non-space opera, non-action and non-emotional enduring version of Interstellar. But that stands out as an original, highly entertaining and beautifully directed sci-fi-adventure of science. 

The year was 2013, and 'Gravity' broke all expectations. Both the critics and the audience adored the space-drama. It opened an almost closed subgenre; the more realistic and scientifically accurate side of sci-fi. It smashed the box-office numbers and it's going to be the movie that changed the space-genre. 2014 delivered an ambitious and mind-but also a heart breaking-sci-fi adventure of the relationship between a father and his daughter. Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' couldn't match 'Gravity' and its box-office numbers, but it managed to bring big directors to the genre. 2015 is no exception and one of the most influential directors in the genre of space/horror is back; with 'The Martian' - the third installment in this realistic-science(-fiction) adventure that Gravity managed to put on the map. 

'The Martian' stars Matt Damon as the leading role, and he subsidize with emotion and surprisingly much humor to the film. The direction by Ridley Scott is without any doubt excellent with the extraordinary cinematography and realistic views on Mars. The science-aspect is just as present and it keeps giving the movie realism in a not very distant future. We follow Mark Watney's struggle to survive on the hostile red planet, and he's very self-entertained, funny and extremely optimistic. Just his presence is exciting and the movie therefor never felt boring. He struggles with these almost impossible tasks, we see him develop through his ups and downs on his journey back to the blue planet. There're much human traces like humor, attachment and morality, and it really is about one character, left alone by himself. So uniquely done! 

It's not a movie that's action-packed nor high-paced; it's a well preformed and well written art of work and that really is entertaining. It's one aspect that might result in lost of interest by some individuals, but there are some incredibly great wow-and-high-paced moments where you really want to be there, and experience it by yourself! The 3D is better than the average movie, but doesn't add anything extraordinary to the experience. But something that totally did is the soundtrack; so fitting and baffling to the specific character and moment! But the dialogs might drag the movie down a bit; they can feel forced to the audience from time to time when it comes to facts, etc. 

The plot is not one-dimensional (but sometimes a bit predictable); it covers many characters at different locations (even planets). We have strong leading actors and well visualized characters. One minor concern is that it might have too many smaller roles, they absorb some of the excitement and focus of the movie. It loose some of the magic, especially in the third act. The main characters could also have had a greater attachment, there's no strong chemistry between them. But these are just minor aspects that could have been even greater, and it really is good movie, even though the ending might be a bit too rushed and could have covered more of the climax. 

'The Martian' might not be flawless but it got a strong and funny lead from Matt Damon, and very rememberable moments that you should love to experience by yourself. It really is a realistic sci-fi flick full of humor, adventure, optimism and hope. It's the 2015-Interstellar.

2.0,"I never read or listened to the book. I saw this movie last night knowing only the plot basics.

The film lacked character development or at least assumes all viewers have read the books and jumps time without any suspense or emotion at all really. The crew are missing the first half of the film so the viewer never feels a connection between Watney or his crew mates. There are lots of not funny inside jokes from Watney while marooned but again, you can't connect them to the crew because you don't know anything about them other than they joke about each other. 

I was hoping for a more Hanks in castaway feel to be marooned on Mars but Damon failed to deliver. It wasn't all his fault though. There was absolutely no backstory for him other than he was a botanist. 

I thought the science was awesome and that was the best part of the whole movie. I think I'll give the audio book s listen now because I'm sure the written story is much better and I've heard wonderful things about it.",Steven Z,False,False,False,False,2.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Steven Z,/user/id/850576874,RT,850576874,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/735919017/picture,The Martian
3.5,"The opening to this film was amazing, Ridley Scott doing what he does best and filling the viewer with anxiety and tension.  Matt Damon i thought was also great in this role.  I felt a real connection to the charcter and I really cared for his survival.  That was the only character i felt anything for in this film.  I felt the character development for all the other characters was really poor.  I wouldn't mind but they seemed to take up large chunks of the film when i was really happy to stay with Matt Damon on Mars. 

At times it was Roland Emmerich esque, and super cheesy 90's disaster movie like.  It might not have been such a big deal for me if this was the language of the film from the start but it seemed to clash with this really personal journey we were on with Damon's character.  It was like mixing Duncan Jones Moon with Armageddon (not a good match)  The entire section of Bowies Starman made me cringe, this film didn't need a montage and really it was the ENTIRE SONG!!!.  

I felt nothing for the other characters on the ship back to Earth, i felt offended when i was expected to feel sympathy for them with the scene of them talking to their family's about having to stay in space longer.  If you want me to feel sympathy for these characters then they need to be developed a lot more.  If you showed me a scene with Damon talking to a loved one or a family member then i would have been more moved emotionally.  

Don't even get me started on Donald Glovers character, probably the most pointless role in the film, obviously put in to inject as some comic relief even though Damon was already providing this.  When he reveals his ""genius"" idea to NASA i was thinking really? like they wouldn't have already thought of this.  If this film lost all of the crap at NASA and on Earth where it became a 90's cheesy disaster film and focused more on the crew on the way back to Earth and more time spent with Damon i felt it could have been a 5 star rating but for me it's a 3.5.

4.5,"The Martian is an incredible movie. I don't know how else to say it. It has a run-time of two hours and 14-minutes, but I can't remember a moment when I thought it was dragging. The Martian had drama, comedy, and action. 

Damon created a character that everyone in the theater was rooting for. I don't think it mattered as much who the supporting cast was, but it was a massive list.  Everyone was on top of their games. From the people on the ground, Wiig, Bridges, Ejiofor, to Watney's fellow crew, with the likes of Pena and Chastain out front, everyone was fantastic.

The visuals are dazzling and cinematically spectacular, making you feel like you're looking at the strange and beautiful Martian landscape. Matt Damon's performance as Mark Watney is phenomenal and inspiring, dealing humorously and cleverly with his predicament: complete isolation on a deserted alien landscape. The simple idea of being completely alone on a different planet where not only do you have to find a way to survive, but also a way to go home, none of which will be an easy task, is mind-boggling to think about, but becomes even more incredible after watching Damon capture all of the struggle, fear, courage and determination it takes to accept and deal with this situation.",Connor C,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Connor C,/user/id/968854407,RT,968854407,,The Martian

5.0,"Top Movies of 2015 - #1

In a year packed with great movies, and perhaps one of the better years since 2012, the Martian is a movie that stands out among the pack. The plot, about being stranded on Mars, alone can carry this movie. But its doesn't stop there, throw in a memorable and energetic performance by Matt Damon, and an equally great job by the co-stars, you have a movie that propels itself into space. The light tone of the movie, helps to ease the tension, but also make it an absolute joy to watch. In fact, it allows the movie to hold up to repeated viewings and even improve on said viewings. Unlike Interstellar, The Martian seems wholly plausible, which makes it an even more interesting watch. there's also the soundtrack, which should be noted as being a total joy to listen to. Perhaps that is what the Martian embodies, joy and happiness. You won't assume a movie about a guy being stranded on Mars would make you laugh so much, or encourage you to watch it with a group of buddies, but it does exactly that. Hell, you could watch this alone if you want to entertain yourself for a solid 2 hours, or if you even want to learn something.

5.0,"Finally! Ridley Scott is back!!

Now I reserve my right to remove that comment if his next project sucks; but this is a big, big step in the right direction (pun intended). 

What I liked:

So, this movie is about 2 and a bit hours long (about 20 mins long) but I didn't feel it at all! And I'm usually not one for long movies but when this ended I felt sad and wanted more like I never have before because I was having so much fun with 'The Martian. Not to say it was open ended or shouldn't have ended when it did. I just wanted it to keep going and going and going. But the biggest strength right out of the blocks, and this is a little spoilery but not really, is the movie starts... ""The Martian'... GO! And it just starts within 5 mins he's alone on Mars and we can start our movie! I love when a film can do this, doesn't piss about just tells a great story!

What I disliked:

Uh... Come back to me?

Direction:

Ridley Scott wasn't attached to this project from the start and I was a little worried about that, but I didn't have to be at all! He breathes so much life into this movie. I'm sitting in my seat and whether it's Matt Damon on Mars or the crew back on Earth, Scott does a amazing job making you feel like you are there, with them and you want to get this man home so badly and a lot of that is down to the direction. It's so beautifully shot. I don't know where it's shot, a studio behind a green screen, some desert somewhere? But if you told me that actually shot on Mars I think id believe you. I am very guilible but that's not the point! 
And another thing, like I said this movie is over 2 hours long and i can not think of a time, and believe me I've tried, that there was a single frame wasted in this movie! Every single frame served a purpose to push the story along nicely and at a beautiful pace! And this does mean, sorry people but no toilet breaks. Look I like to pee as much as anyone but if you leave to pee 1 of 2 things is gonna happen.
1. You're gonna walk out, (and this is a fact) you're going to miss something huge and some poor soul sat with you is gonna have I catch you up.
2. (And this happened 10 feet to my right) you're gonna be walking towards the exit but can't take your eyes off the screen because it's so good. You're gonna walk the wrong way towards the exit and walk right into the wall! Huge bang, everyone is going to laugh at you and your silly white dress. Poor girl. 

Characters:

While I can see Matt Damon getting a Oscar nod for Mark Watney right now there are so many ""Oscar movies"" still to come out I'm not sure but my word his performance in this is fantastic! Probably the best we've ever got from Damon, and that says a lot considering great showings like Good Will Hunting and The Departed. But there are a lot of other players here that shouldn't be over looked. Jeff Daniles, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor sink into their characters so well it's gonna go over people's heads that we are looking at 3 names like theirs! Oh, and Benedict Wong as the chief engineer bloke was so fun! The way everyone is portrayed at times I felt like I was watching true events, like documentary footage. It's so convincing, and everyone are likeable, yet real people.

The feels:

This movie hit home in every way you want a movie to effect you! I was shocked at how incredibly funny it was, this man was left alone on Mars but he still is able to keep his head and he does crack jokes and keeps himself entertained, but it never felt unbelievable. Obviously for spoiler reasons I won't say what, but there where 5-6 times where the entire audience in my theatre mirrored the emotion of the character on screen. Whether we're laughing with them, filled with delight or are groaning or gasping 'The Martian' is such an immersive flick.

Final thoughts:

There's a very subtle underlying message to 'The Martian', which I do kinda wish they'd played on more, which is ""one man, for all of us is worth it!"" And my God to you feel that buzzing around the theatre. 
If you can only see one movie coming out this week, you're kinda spoiled for choice really, with Sicario, The walk (US) and Black Mass (US) still on the screens I would have to send you to 'The Martian', granted I haven't seen the Walk or black mass because I'm English, I have so much faith in this movie. All film is subjective I know but I won't understand people who don't like this movie. The Martian feels like castaway, meets Apollo 13 and I think I liked it more that both of these! In fact, if not my favourite film of the year so far, it challenges inside out for me. Matt Damon makes Tom Hanks look like a pussy! 
I can't recommend this movie more it gets 5/5 for me! Almost perfect movie!",Danny P,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Danny P,/user/id/971780949,RT,971780949,,The Martian

4.0,"Now here's a rather excellent blockbuster, perhaps the best of the year, with Ridley Scott at his whimsical best. Almost oppositely to last year's gloomy space pic Interstellar, The Martian is almost aggressively light in tone, and for the most part, all the better for it. With a sweepingly brilliant ensemble cast, both on earth and in space, this is a consistently entertaining and sparky piece with a wonderful lead turn from Damon, essentially carrying the picture for long periods of time. It's also a rather gorgeous film, with a pleasingly glossy visual aesthetic and a few notably beautiful shots populating the screen. Compile all of this and you're left with unadulterated fun; it may not linger in the mind soon after, but just revelling in a glorious montage set to Bowie's Starman (which somehow doesn't feel cheap?) is enough for me.

The story is smart, in ways that might surprise you at times. The cast was brilliant and the story while somewhat long winded in parts it still pretty engaging. You find yourself rooting for Matt Damon in a plausible scenario once NASA can successfully send people to Mars and got to admit I learn't a few new things myself.

One big downside is that if you were to watch it in 2D as opposed to 3D you won't miss much. It added some decent elements towards the end and the odd zero gravity scene or two but go in expecting Gravity all over again you'd probably be disappointed.

I was going to start in the beginning of the year, but since there are some great movies coming out in the last weeks of December, I'll start early. On that not I'll start with the Martian. ""During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible rescue mission."" This movie has to be Ridley Scott's best movie over the past 8 years. I didn't have much confidence in him, especially after The Counselor. The cast does an incredible job, especially Matt Damon. Not since Tom Hanks in Castaway has one character been able to capture our attention, The only thing is Matt Damon does a better job and actually brings some comedy to the performance.

4.0,"It's a solid space movie with fine performances from a star studded ensemble led by Matt Damon in one of his more engaging movie performances in the past few years. It just had many pacing issues where it left me thinking ""I wonder what's happening with NASA right now I feel like we've been watching Damon for too long"" and then a couple of scenes later ""what's happening with Damon I feel like we've been with NASA for too long"" and the whole movie except the end ""what's happening with Chastain and company on the space ship we haven't seen them since the beginning"" The balance of the movie was my main issue with the movie but it still is good and entertaining for the most part. Jeff Daniels is great as the head of NASA proving that he needs more strong roles like this in film, Donald Glover has a small part but provides some great laughs, and Chiwetel Edjiofor is great too. Kristen Wiig was fine but I feel like she needed to switch parts with Mackenzie Davis. Jessica Chastain is good but kind of wasted with maybe 20 minutes of screen time. Many are pointing out how hilarious this movie is but it really is just a couple of good laughs and then Damon making a lot of dumb dad jokes. Ridley Scott hasn't made a solid movie in a while (I would say since Robin Hood though most don't agree with me) so it was nice to see him do something worth while again. The soundtrack is fun and well put together (especially the end credits song which may be the best end credits song of all time). The science isn't too much to check out for if you aren't a science enthusiast like myself but toward the end of the movie you kind of give up trying to follow what Damon is going to do next and just let it happen and hope for the best. The cinematography is stunning, the visual effects are good for the most part but some of the floating in the space shuttle were a tad off and showing flaws, and the sound design is really great as well.

4.5,"Has Ridley Scott finally returned to form with The Martian? Well seeing that The Martian turned out to be one of the best films of the year, you can say yes! After a period of mediocracy by Scott, The Martian was a reminder that Scott is one of the great directors living today. 
When you initially look at this film on paper, you see an amazing cast, good writer, and shaky director, but this film had it all. First of all it is amazing to look at. The cinematography is stellar, shot by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Alice in Wonderland). Ridley Scott's execution of this film was outstanding, he made you feel like they were actually on Mars.
When you look at this cast, which has various Oscar nominated actors you are expecting the performances to be good (maybe not great cause look how the Counselor turned out), and they deliver big time! Matt Damon who played Mark Watney was obviously the star of the movie. He delivered on all aspects, and might be one of his best performances of his career. Jeff Daniels (Teddy Sanders) does an amazing job in this movie, playing a real human being, a business man who is concerned only about what is best for NASA. He is not the antagonist at all, even though he might be made out to seem like it. The whole crew consisting of Jessica Chastain (Melissa Lewis), Sebastian Stan (Chris Beck), Michael Peña (Rick Martinez), Kate Mara (Beth Johanssen), and Aksel Hennie (Alex Vogel) played off each other so wonderfully. It seems like they have been together for such a long time and the chemistry is beautiful. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Vincent Kapoor) was superb, but when is he not? Sean Bean was Sean Bean really, nothing super spectacular, but not bad. Kristen Wigg, leaving we can say her comfort zone in comedy and doing some drama, did well, didn't disappoint. Surprising performance came from Mackenzie Davis (Mindy Park) who blew me away. My least favorite was Donald Glover who seemed out of place in this movie and was one really slight negative, but did not detach me from the film.
This movie is really an original piece, of human survival and hope. Ridley Scott managed to make this movie feel so real, you were scared for the well being of Matt Damon while he was stuck on Mars. The writing was outstanding as well, done by Drew Goddard. It was the perfect blend of comedy and suspense. The big things I was worried did not happen at all. Mainly being that the movie seemed to spoiled by the trailers, but it wasn't! Also the science behind it all which I thought could become confusing, wasn't! 
This film ended up being one of my favorite of the year, and made me remember what a great director Ridley Scott can be, and don't be surprised come Oscar time, you see The Martian in the running for an award.

4.0,"I read the book and loved it. I saw the movie, and have mild thoughts about it. It's assumed that the book is normally better than the movie. So I'll just highlight the main differences:
The book starts off when he wakes up with his predicament. The movie starts from a chronological order, which de-emphasizes the initial mystery.
The book gives heavy emphasis on science. The movie glosses over it from time to time, obviously for the audience.
Mark Watney is WAY funnier in the book. Mildly entertaining in the movie.
There is a lot more reference to his 'shitty' situation in the book. This was the most tonge and cheek element of the book, which was missed.
His struggle wasn't as epic in the movie, as it was in the book. Hundreds of nights in the rover, back and forth.
Also, the ending was added on, for what purpose, I don't know. Perhaps to inspire future space adventurers?

5.0,"Sir Ridley Scott's instantly gripping edge-of-your-seat tense sci-fi thriller which is visually striking and terrifically acted. It concerns an American Astronaut named Mark Watney, played phenomenally by Matt Damon in a magnetic performance, who during a manned mission to Mars is left for dead after a powerful dust storm forces the rest of the crew to abort their expeditionary mission and leave. Mark, a botanist on the Ares III mission must now use his ingenuity if he hopes to survive the hostile Martian environment, and figure out how to stretch his very limited food supply until the scheduled arrival of a Mars lander some four years later, he also needs to find a way to contact earth and let them know that he is still alive, he succeeds and back on earth NASA discovers a way to bring Mark back, but they will face their own set of obstacles. Sensational direction by Scott, who gives us an awesome crowd-pleasing spectacle that will have audiences cheering on their feet. The ensemble cast is brilliant with exceptional performances by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, and Danald Glover, but this is Matt Damon's film all the way, and his show-stopping performance is the heart of this fine motion picture.

4.0,"Who would've known there would be an actually good film by Ridley Scott after years of creative drought? And yet, here we are. Adapted from Andy Weir's science fiction novel of the same name by Drew Goddard, Scott's The Martian strands an astronaut on Mars and forces him to ""science the shit"" out of his predicament in what is essentially Cast Away (2000) on the barren, desolate red planet. And for what it's worth, The Martian pulls off its myriad of science exposition with tact, being delivered through characters internalizing a problem rather than the writer/director outright spoon-feeding the audience.

Divided between three settings - Watney on Mars, the Ares III crew led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), and the situation on Earth being handled by NASA - The Martian insists on its science fiction-survival/tragedy premise, with Goddard and Scott keeping the bureaucracies on Earth at bay just enough for the film to not be bogged down by the flatly written damage control by NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), which then quickly - thankfully - shifts gears from Sanders' attempts at salvaging the space agency's public face, into a rescue attempt as engineers of all manner come together to bring Watney home.

Back on Mars, Damon continues carrying the film - despite the ensemble cast - as the prime actor that is actually fulfilling his end of the acting bargain; Donald Glover comes in second as the twitchy astrophysicist Rich Purnell. The Martian's sequences on Mars are less about tension and more about the unbridled optimism of man in the face of adversity; something Damon translates on screen perfectly. Moments that place Watney in peril are almost constantly short-lived, as the character makes a joke or quip almost immediately after like it's a Marvel film, dissolving the ""I'm not dying here"" tension with humor. But The Martian was never a story that was meant to beat the human spirit into submission; it is instead a story that celebrates the human will and condition to continuously persevere against increasingly stacked odds. In that regard, the film entertainingly achieves what it sets out to do, but sadly, nothing more.",Mark M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 03, 2015",Mark M,/user/id/963822019,RT,963822019,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100007997433175/picture,The Martian
5.0,"Buckle in kids, this is gonna be a long one.  Rarely does a movie come together so close to perfection as this one.  From the director Ridley Scott (arguably the best sci-fi director of all time- see Alien, Blade Runner) to the lead actor Matt Damon (my bro joked America sure has spent a lot of money retrieving him- see Saving Private Ryan, Interstellar), to the supporting cast (Jeff Daniels, Don Glover, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, etc), to the writers Andy Weir (who wrote my favorite book since Jurassic Park) and Drew Goddard (writer of Lost and Daredevil episodes along with Cabin in the Woods). 
 
The movie's strength is its subtle comedy, from Matt Damon's fun video diary to a LOTR joke involving Sean Bean's character.  This movie is Castaway on a deserted planet instead of island, but much smarter.  Volleyballs are exchanged for potatoes, and every time Mark Whatney sciences the shit out of something we find ourselves smiling.

First of all, it's not even comparable to Interstellar, slightly better than Gravity and easily the best sci-fi film based on plain reality, ie it's better than Apollo 13. Martian has plenty of comedy, but the film is shamelessly made ultra PG-13. Matt Damon gives a good performance, but on the whole the film lacks emotional resonance as well as psychological tension that one is supposed to feel when he or she is left behind that too in a fucking lonely planet. The scenery is great and the visual effects are good and the last 30 minutes of the film are gripping. The film however lags a lot here and there especially when Damon is not in screen. The film is too full of unnecessary characters who simply deprive Damon of his valuable screen time. Kristen Wiig's character is one of the most dumbest female characters ever written in the recent times as a result of purely sexist writing and many unwanted characters like that of Sean Bean's, Kristein Wiig's, Kate Mara's and the rest of the crew's simply waste valuable time.",Jayakrishnan R,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 03, 2015",Jayakrishnan R,/user/id/934786800,RT,934786800,,The Martian

3.5,"At first glance I had do desire to see this movie. I was was basing this notion on how much I hated Interstellar. Was I willing to see Matt Damon in another Space movie? But after I found out that Ridley Scott was the director I became more interested. 

But wait! The last several movies he's done have been either God Awful, or extremely forgettable. But once more unto the breach. 

As i turns out I was surprised. For a movie about a man trapped on Mars, I found that the pacing, acting, script, and the direction never lost my interest. It was what I wanted Interstellar to be. A movie where the science of the movie is not only plausible, but the numbers seem to add up for the non-rocket scientist crowd. 
Even though this might have been an even better movie for an actor with more weight, Damon does an fine job as the lead, as does the all-star cast. Some of who seemed a bit out of place and star cramming. But there's nothing that seems so out of place that it distracts you. 
Bottom line this is one of the better movies that Scott has directed in a while, but it's very predictable. With all the usual ""Lost in Space/Space rescue"" cliches.

2.5,"There's a scene in The Martian-Matt Damon's new space epic about an astronaut marooned on Mars-where crew members inform their loved ones on earth that their already lengthy space odyssey will be extended another 523 days, to which these loved ones casually acquiesce as if a waiter had just told them the appetizers would be out a few minutes late.  This is one of many scenes in a movie that may have gotten the science right but gets the human emotional elements all wrong.

The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott, starts as movies like this must, with astronauts conducting research on Mars, a freak storm blows in and Mark Watney (the botanist-astronaut played by Damon) gets left behind.  This scene is fine, as are scenes where Watney devises some quite ingenious ways to survive on the red planet (""I'm going to science the sh*t out of this."").  In watching these scenes, one can't help but think of Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away,"" another ""dessert island"" film of a different stripe.  But what Cast Away had in abundance, the Martian utterly lacks: that deepest yearning for hearth and home.  Sure, Watney is distraught by his plight and does everything in his power to get back home but it feels as if the screenplay approaches these challenges like some scientific version of American Ninja Warrior-with a love of problem-solving, not necessarily a more tender love of the heart or of life itself.  This shows through in the somewhat procedural reading of Damon's dialogue (he mostly talks into a video log) that plays more like a table read for a VCR instruction manual biopic than a scientist who is sincerely frightened yet simultaneously jazzed by his uncertain fate.  These logs are straight exposition and rather clunky.  

The rest of the cast is rounded out by some heavy hitters, almost none of whom are asked to do any heavy hitting.  Jessica Chastain plays Melissa Lewis, the captain of the Hermes spacecraft, who ultimately decides to leave Watney behind.  Here is another opportunity for the film to strike some sort emotional cord but Lewis exhibits little regret over her decision to ditch Watney and a similarly muted level of exuberance upon learning of his survival.  The only shining member of the crew-that also features Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, a computer wiz, and Sebastian Stan as Chris Beck, a...actually, I'm not sure what his character does...-is Michael Pena.  Pena delivers the movie's best scene of dialogue when the Hermes crew is finally able to communicate with Watney and, rather than spout off clichéd platitudes, he busts Watney's chops about how the ship is roomier without him.  This is a fresh and original approach to this well-worn episode and left me wishing the movie had more of it.  (As a side note, can Hollywood have just one movie where the astronauts on screen look like real astronauts?  At times I wasn't sure if Ridley Scott was filming from the deck of the Hermes or the set of a United Benetton ad.)  

Back on earth, the usual array of characters bicker over the usual array of concerns: budgeting; press attention; the mental well-being of the astronauts; etc.  Most of the banter occurs between Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), the director of NASA, and Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the director of the Mars mission.  Daniels actually breathes new life into the conventional wet blanket director role when he recommends skipping a vital inspection stage for a rocket being built at breakneck pace so that supplies can be delivered to Watney before one of those tricky space-time windows closes.  Kristen Wiig also stars in this movie and I have no idea why.  She plays Annie Montrose, some sort of NASA press liaison, and she brings none of her vast talents to the role, nor are any talents whatever required of the role; the character is completely unnecessary.  It boggles the mind why someone as gifted as Wiig would choose to take such an ornamental part in this film.  She has essentially committed the movie equivalent of a photobomb.   

Despite all the scientific wizardry pulled off by Watney and the crew of the Hermes, there is one scene where I simply could not suspend disbelief.  At one point during the rescue mission, Watney becomes disenchanted with NASA headquarters and decides to issue an expletive-laced communique.  During the tirade, Watney types, ""are you f***ing kidding me?""  Reader, I did not edit that expletive; that is exactly how it appeared on screen.  Why?  Are we to believe that Watney edited himself in what were potentially his last moments?  Or that some NASA wonk stopped feverishly crunching numbers to scrub out the profane letters with a few asterisks?  What makes this worse is that Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, in a clumsy attempt at humor, offers various interpretations of the alleged dirty sentence by repeating it several times, changing his inflection each time.  But one thing Ejiofor does not do in his little standup act is say the damned curse word!  He omits it each time he repeats the sentence!  I am not making this point to campaign for more explicit language in films.  I'm merely puzzled as to why a movie would voluntarily bring up this language and then take such pains to try and avoid it.  Was it an attempt to be edgy but also maintain its PG-13 rating?  Probably.  But what a failed attempt.  And therein lays my problem with The Martian:  unlike its hero, the movie is afraid to be daring and really push the envelope with the interesting themes it evokes.

After two misses with ""The Counsellor"" (One of the worst movies I've ever seen) and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"", Ridley Scott delivers a really well made movie with ""The Martian"".

It seems now that every year we get a new space adventure. ""Gravity"", ""Interstellar"" then this and I can safely say that this is the funniest out of all three. I was really surprised about how many times the theatre erupted with laughter. And it's not just a bunch of stupid gags either, it's the witty banter between Matt Damon and the rest of the cast including his video blogs on Mars. Speaking of Mars, there are lots of great shots of it in this movie. Great wide and epic shots that make the planet look awesome. Matt Damon is fantastic and some of the supporting cast is really entertaining too like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Pena and Mackenzie Davis. The only real flaw I found with this movie was that some of the supporting cast didn't have an impact on me at all. Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sebastion Stan... total snoozefests. I couldn't get invested in what these characters were doing and quite frankly, I didn't care.

Director: Ridley Scott
Review:
'The Martian' comes as another promising movie after recent spectacular screenplay of 'Interstellar'. I too watched the movie with high hope and some path breaking science but for me, it failed to recreate the magic.
The story revolves around an astronaut 'Mark' who along with team lands on MARS for a mission. Due to natural circumstances the team has to make an unplanned exist, assuming Mark to be dead during the exit launch. The story starts to unravel when news of Mark being alive arrives and thus begins the journey of survival of human life on a planet with no life.
This movie will engage people mostly with interest in science or in alternate solutions to common problems. It explores the possibility to grow food where nothing grows by applying basic scientific principles, as aptly mentioned in words of Mark, ""Science the shit out of it"".
However, the movie fails to touch other issues and is mostly focused on one person as if capturing the life only. It stretched too much on the journey and daily activities. It loses touch with the audience and starts revolving like a documentary more. Also the end of the movie is quite dramatic and I fail to believe that any government organization will have the courage ever to burn billions of dollars just to get back one human life. AND if so, then it makes one wonder why would so many lives be ignored in the current humanitarian crisis. 
'The Martian' is one example of cinema's relentless drive to create future with space travel on canvas, but I kept questioning if it will still be true few hundred years from now when we do a real travel to MARS.

4.5,"I absolutely love space. Between the unknown, the grand scale, and the unlimited possibilities; space is something I find fascinating. As a kid there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to become an astronaut when I grew up. As I got older I knew that it wouldn't be a possibility. It's no surprise that space films are my favorite types of films. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and when the sci-fi movie takes place in space, oh man I'm like a kid in a candy store while watching a science fiction space film. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Gravity, Alien, Aliens, Moon, and Interstellar are all films that I consider to be some of my all-time favorites. After seeing The Martian its not too far off from those other films. This is great, but not quite on the same level as the space films I mentioned above.

As of late, Ridley Scott hasn't exactly been top notch. I did like Prometheus, but many did not. I hated The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings was incredibly boring. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried about The Martian despite its fantastic cast and great subject material (I read the book).

The Martian has restored my faith in Ridley Scott's ability as a director. In all honestly, I think Ridley deserves an Oscar Nomination for best director. The direction in this movie is nothing short of outstanding. This movie looks absolutely fantastic. Mars looked incredible. Space looked incredible. Everything looked incredible! From a technical standpoint, this is phenomenal.

Like Ridley Scott, Matt Damon gives his best work in years. A great comeback film for both of these guys. All the performances are great. I was most surprised by Kristen Wiig. I don't think I've ever seen her in a non-comedy role and to my surprise she ended up being pretty great here.

Part of what makes this movie so enjoyable of course is its tone, which is very unlike your typical ""disaster scenario"" film. It's fresh, looks amazing, and made me very nostalgic about my life-long passion for astronomy. Unlike Interstellar, The Martian never aspires to tell a grander story about the universe. This has its pros and cons; you leave the theater excited about the adventure story, but I didn't find myself reflecting too much about my place in the universe.

From Gravity to Interstellar and now The Martian, we haven't seen space come alive like this since Apollo 13.

5.0,"The Martian was out of this world. Yes I know that is cheesy but this movie was amazing. A lot of people will compare this movie to the last years space movie Interstellar and it is definitely up to the standard and comparison. Lead by an all star cast starring Matt Damon Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Donald Glover. Each one delivers an all star performance that form characters that you grow to love and root for. Matt Damon specifically is amazing in this movie. When a man is stranded and the only person on a planet, you can imagine emotions would be high. Damon does an incredible job of portraying those emotions and also brings forth comedic relief in an excellent form. This is a very stressful and high intensity film at times and the comedic relief was a pleasant surprise and best of all, didn't feel forced into the situation at all. The writing, the special effects and the directing (the amazing Ridley Scott) well all spectacular. This movie is over 2 hrs long but it doesn't feel like it. Time flies because you are so sucked into this movie. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie and I don't want to give too much of the story away. Usually I try and think of some things that I might change or what they could have improved on but I am drawing a blank. You guys will just have to see it for yourself and see what you think. I would highly suggest seeing it!

3.0,"I enjoyed the movie right up until our introduction to Mr. Purnell. From that point on I lost my ability to suspend my disbelieve. The suggestion that Purnell -- a twenty-something frat-boy -- needs to explain to the head of JPL how a spacecraft can get a gravity assist by orbiting a planet, insults the intelligence of the audience. And he explains this concept the way a goofy 10-year old might explain it to his 8-year old sibling, using a stapler as a spaceship and people in the room to represent planets, complete with rocket sound effects). We didn't need this comic relief. Matt Damons's character gave us just the right amount of humor in a way that was believable.

Ridley Scott  did an impressive job with the adaptation that could have been mishandled by a lesser talent. Matt Damon became Mark Watney and owned the role. It isn't easy to find a leading man (or woman) who can keep me interested for 2 1/2 hours but Damon made it look easy. The Martian also features a strong supporting cast, top notch VFX, and they made it all look believable. The script kept the best parts of the book including Watney's sharp sense of humor. I won't go into detail because spoilers but I was very pleased with how they adapted the book.

4.5,"A powerful, inspiring and possibly full of future awards story of Saving Matt Damon, in space!

There's one common message on this year's cinematic experience: if you find yourself at hostile sci-fi world, see Charlize Theron (Furiosa) or Matt Damon for a lovely road trip. The Martian is an uplifting castaway tale on Mars. Brilliantly executed and acted, it's a triumphant story of a man surviving on his wit and sheer positive determination on live. 

The saying ""he might as well be on the moon"" doesn't apply to Mark Watney (Matt Damon) as he's stranded on a world much farther. After a critical failure on space mission leaves him alone on Mars, he must overcome multitude of problems to keep himself and the hope of rescue alive. 

For a desolated story, The Martian is incredibly inspiring. Much of it charm depends entirely on Matt's performance, his effort keeps the movie light and humorous even though tougher times linger just steps or miles away. It probably wouldn't have worked with lesser actor, not just with the dialogues but physical transformation. He brings strangely infectious joy instead of constant wallowing. The positive and identifiable attitude of his character will translate well to audience. 

This is not only a solo mission since there's also perspectives of people working on our planet. The assembly of cast is very good. From Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and many others, these personalities are highly memorable. They make the arduous and lengthy process of space travel into an engaging spectacle. While not everyone has contact with the solitary astronaut, they convincingly unite on the larger-than-life endeavor. 

Visual is amazing. This is not the beast Gravity was, but when it gets going, it's utterly beautiful and also bizarrely captivating since Mars is a barren soil. At times it appears that Matt Damon walks across red desert which is so strange but still give the feeling that it probably exist somewhere. The amount of details on science is amazing, it feels like an inviting project or a trip audience could take with these characters. The bits of pop culture reference from comics or movies are icing of the frosty cake. 

The Martian is what a movie should strive to be, an amazingly told story of men against their predicament.

The directing...same. If this wasn't already on your ""go see"" list, add it! (And except for some language here and there, kids old enough to understand an adult script should love it as well.

In ""The Martian"", botanist astronaut Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, is presumed dead after a sandstorm on Mars forces the mission to be cancelled and the crew must return to earth, without him or his body. Being alive but wounded he quickly takes care of himself and makes an inventory of what he has food wise and what he has to do to stay alive until the next space mission arrives on Mars four years in the future. Regarding the former he knows there is only a month's supply but being a botanist he starts working on rationing and possibly growing food with what he has on hand.

Though director Ridley Scott has had success with sci-fi pictures such as ""Alien"", and this is very much a picture in that genre, it is more a picture of a man's will to survive in spite of all the odds against him. We follow Mark through a series of video diaries explaining how he grows potatoes using human waste, exploring ways to get in touch with his crew on the way back to earth or the people at NASA monitoring the mission along with fighting the elements. Drew Goddard, who wrote the screenplay based on the book by Andy Weir, has a lot of technical talk to relay to the audience and, truthfully, though I didn't understand 80-90% of what was being said and/or explained I was able to follow and be intrigued what was going on in the film.

With a strong supporting cast of Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and a memorable cameo by Donald Glover, strong direction by Scott and many outstanding jobs by the various production personal who will certainly win awards,  ""The Martian"" belongs to Matt Damon.

Damon, as Watney, shows the man's humor, determination to survive, resourcefulness, not to forget his drawing the audience in wondering if he will make it back to earth. He can depreciate himself while at the same time listing his accomplishments as the first person to do many things in space always keeping the viewers on his side and hoping he will succeed. It is this element of doubt that adds a surprising suspense to the story before the end. 

One quibble is that at 2 hours and 20 minutes ""The Martian"" is about 20 minutes too long. Oh yes a warning---no, not a spoiler--hope you like disco music along with Abba and Gloria Gaynor!

Mas à medida que as exigências intelectuais para roteiros do gênero no presente são outras, ""The Martian"" não faz bem ao emular aquela velha receita.

A primeira parte do filme, Matt Damon utilizando seus conhecimentos em botânica para se virar no planeta vermelho, é de fato estimulante e traz a esperança de um filme promissor. Depois, quando toda a atenção se concentra nos desimportantes e burocráticos procedimentos da NASA, a agulha vai de 100 a 20 rapidinho. E até o final fica oscilando ali, ora um pouco pra cima, ora um pouco pra baixo. Ridley Scott imprime uma direção bela e fina, mas não salva o filme. Indo à contramão de tudo o que tem se falado sobre ""The Martian"" e seus recentes trabalhos em geral, acho que o veterano se notabiliza em ""Exodus"".

4.5,"Ridley Scott has made some of the most enduring classics of all time in his 40-year career (Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner). On the other hand, he has also managed to totally wet the bed in many of his productions, especially in recent years (The Counselor, Robin Hood). This big-hit-or-big-miss track record keeps him surprisingly vital for a 77-year-old man, with his successes often directly relating to their source material. With his most recent, The Martian, an adaptation of a hugely popular novel, he uses that original story to create a beautiful and spirited stranded-planet adventure that rivals anything Scott has done in decades. 
The survival tale of a NASA astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars begs comparison to recent space disaster films Gravity and Interstellar. While Martian is comparable to those movies high-points in visuals and sheer thrills, it surpasses both in sheer personality. Even though much of Scott's galactic epic focuses on hard science, botany theories, and public relations problems, it far exceeds its inherent dryness with a lively and sharply funny script, and a wonderfully believable turn by Damon. His brainy and silly performance is backed by a deep sense of fear and awe, as he reconciles and even revels in his newfound heroism while never forgetting its colossal danger.
This epic tale is told surprisingly economically, never reaching too far past its focal points and keeping us completely engaged. Martian's parable of ingenuity and the will to survive is a smart and fully entertaining science fiction outing that reminds us what great big movies can be: funny, uplifting, transporting, and exhilarating.",Matt G,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 02, 2015",Matt G,/user/id/906794753,RT,906794753,,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Drew Goddard. It stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kirsten Wiig and a slew of other equally talented actors.

The Martian is about manned mission to Mars in which Astronaut Mark Watney(Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.

Ridley Scott did it again offering one of the best science fiction movies of this century. After Blade Runner, my personal Favorite of his, and a slew of if-fie movies I wasn't sure how he would ever meet his standard. Well He did!

Scott offers some of the best direction I have ever seen in a science fiction movie. With intense camera-work Scott unleashes the sheer despair of being four years away from one's family, friends, and and most of all planet, while keeping glimmers of hope through out. This works hand in hand with the awesome cinematography done beautifully by Dariusz Wolski. A true beauty technically it holds up just as well in script and acting. My personal favorite scene in the movie was second to last scene in the movie. I was terrified but enthralled.

The script from this movie was brilliant. Excellent Work From Goddard made the movie gripping as well as intellectual. With actual scientific ideas to boot this movie is very hard to pull apart. It holds not only great science fiction but comedy so funny I found myself crying at the hilarity of the moment. With inside joke galore, this was a great script.

Finally the acting. Matt Damon was magnificent in the role of Mark Watney, demonstrating is comic chops and his dramatic finesse. He was optimistic, funny and smart, three characteristics it takes to pull of a role like this.I enjoyed Jessica Chastain, Kirsten Wiig, Kate Mara, and Micheal Pena. I loved Jeff Daniels' somber but caring portrayal of his character. One of my favorite characters was that of Rich Pummel, played by Donald Glover. He was magnetic in the part for such a small role. My favorite character in the movie was Vincent Kapoor played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. He was highly intelligent, witty, charming and resourceful.

With a tight script, direction, cinematography, acting and no glaring issues, I am forced to do this. The Martian Gets an A+.

4.5,"Matt Damon is spaced out! He'd have to be! I mean just look at his body of work from 2013 to 2015! In 2013, in the dystopian sci-fi future of ""Elysium"", he suffers a potentially fatal injury at work and takes considerable risks to get to a giant earth-orbiting space community where the rich and famously uncaring have access to machines that could save his life. In 2014's ""Interstellar"", Damon plays an astronaut trapped alone on an inhospitable and distant planet. In 2015's ""The Martian"" (PG-13, 2:21) Damon plays an astronaut trapped alone on an inhospitable and distant planet. At least in ""The Martian"", his character is a much better person than in ""Interstellar"". But, which one is the better film?

Damon stars as the title character, an astronaut left behind on Mars by his crewmates when they're forced to abruptly abandon their manned mission and have every reason to believe that Damon's character, Mark Watney, was killed in a sudden and violent storm on the planet's surface. Imagine his surprise when he regains consciousness from his relatively minor injury to discover that he's been left on Mars - alone - with no one even realizing that he's still alive! But he's not bitter. No, not this Matt Damon character. Without so much as a ""WTF!"" utterance (at first), Watney immediately deals with his injury and makes a plan to survive until the next scheduled manned mission to Mars - four years hence.

Mark Watney is brilliant, resourceful and has a positive attitude. He's going to need all of that - plus a good dose of luck - if he's ever going to make it back to his native terra firma. Watney figures out a more efficient way to keep the expedition's research complex and equipment powered, to make more water, and to grow food ""on a planet where nothing grows"". He records all his activities on video, with frequent commentary that is both instructive and light-hearted. Even when things are working out fairly well, we've never seen someone so alone on the big screen since Tom Hanks was stranded on a desert island and made friends with a volleyball that he made to look like a human face and named Wilson. 

Of course, playing a solo ""Survivor"" game on the Red Planet will be pointless, as Mark himself notes, if he can't establish communication with NASA. Right after NASA Director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) gives an eloquent and heartfelt eulogy at Mark's in absentia funeral, satellite imagery of equipment changing positions on the Martian surface shows NASA that their missing astronaut is alive and active. With a lot of creativity and brilliance on both sides of the intragalactic void that separates them, Watney and NASA make contact with each other and steadily improve upon their communications capabilities.

As the world starts following every detail of Watney's plight, the greatest minds on and beyond the earth work the problem of getting their boy home - and keeping him alive until they can accomplish that goal. Sanders and his top lieutenants and department heads (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Benedict Wong, Kristen Wiig and Mackenzie Davis - with Donald Glover joining them in the 11th hour) plan for and debate a variety of ways to help Watney. Meanwhile, Watney's crewmates (Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Jessica Chastain, who was also in ""Interstellar"" with Damon) continue to ride their Hermes spacecraft back towards earth, unaware that their sixth is still alive.

""The Martian"" is thrilling, suspenseful, fascinating, heart-felt and surprisingly humorous. Ridley Scott directs Drew Goddard's script based on Andy Weir's book and Damon brings it all to life. Damon is perfectly cast, sympathetic and believable as the stranded astronaut whose positive attitude and sense of humor sustain him as much as his smarts and creative problem-solving. The rest of the performances are consistently solid, but not particularly spectacular. What is indeed as spectacular as you would expect is the cinematography (although I'm not sure that the 3-D adds much to it). The special effects are just enough to sell the story without overwhelming it and the desert of southern Jordan makes a great-looking Martian landscape (as it has previously in other movies set on the 4th rock from the sun). 

The script, which shows Damon ""science the shit out of this"" dilemma, gives us just enough of the jargon to make the story realistic and understandable, but never loses us in the details. The result is that we feel like we're right there for every step of Watney's journey. Although some of the plot points and story structure reminded me of 2013's ""Gravity"", this film effectively charts its own enlightened path. 

""Elysium"" may have starred Matt Damon, but there are two other sci-fi movies that make for more apt comparisons to Matt Damon's 2015 space outing, one that he appeared in and one that he did not, but both of which are very much in the same league as this one. ""The Martian"" is a little more grounded than ""Interstellar"", but not quite as ground-breaking as ""Gravity"". In terms of moviemaking quality and entertainment value, I feel that all three are excellent films and ""The Martian"" fits squarely between the creative existentialism of the former and the awe-inspiring beauty and danger of the latter. When they first came out, I gave ""Interstellar"" an ""A-"", ""Gravity"" an ""A+"" and ""The Martian"" has a good, strong ""A"".",Dave M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 02, 2015",Dave M,/user/id/876318698,RT,876318698,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1454412859/picture,The Martian

4.5,"Ares III, another group mission of NASA astronauts to the Mars may not have originality in plot due to source adaptation and visual effects not as amazing as Academy Awards winner Interstellar, director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Gooddard still manage to turn it into a successful and brilliant sci-fi. It's definitely not scientifically accurate at all levels due to minor flaws, but the story mainly focuses on the survival skills and rescue efforts which are presented in a straightforward, entertaining, chilling, educational yet inspiring way. The film is surprisingly funny compared to Interstellar and Gravity thanks to the outstanding performance from Matt Damon who delivers the character's positive attitude overshadowing the fear of being a stranded stranger on the red planet, other strong star-studded cast including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor have solid performances as well as scores composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, not extremely powerful but strong enough to fit into scenes. While it seems to be a rescue mission, the film is able to deliver an important message - regardless the help from the whole world, self-initiation determines the survival opportunity. Overall at a smaller scale and fans perception, The Martian fits perfectly as sequel of 2013's Gravity and prequel to 2014's Interstellar.",'Michael S,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 02, 2015",'Michael S,/user/id/907131617,RT,907131617,,The Martian

During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to survive and return to Earth.

Based on a best-selling novel by Andy Weir,  The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Drew Goddard. The cast is stacked with Matt Damon as the stranded astronaut, his NASA bosses which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean and Kristen Wig. The rescue crew features Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña and Kate Mara among others. With so many big names, it's amazing how well the characters are portrayed and the amount of time spent is measured just right for each. 

As always with Ridley Scott, the visuals are stunning, from the lifeless yet beautiful landscape of Mars, to the high tech rovers and space stations. Still, practical sets and effects aren't ignored. The original musical score flows wonderfully in the background, a touch of 'Alien' here and there.

There are highs and lows, moments of triumph (growing potatoes) and helplessness (the base entrance malfunction and explosion), but overall the film is more feel good adventure than a typical bleak sci-fi drama. The comedic dialogue, not often the case with recent Scott projects, was surprising. Science heavy at times but not too distracting. Tension is regularly relieved by the witty Matt Damon, Ejiofor and his team, even the soundtrack plays it's part with classic disco hits and of course some Ziggy Stardust too. It all results in the runtime of over two hours flying by with it's perfect pacing and by the end of it, i actually wished for a bit more. 

However the tone at times became super cheesy, such as the Chinese space agency who come to the rescue with valuable technological assistance, and the eye rolling scene where thousands of people cheering in the streets of England and China during the rescue mission being televised around the globe, it felt silly and odd.

Overall, it's not a masterpiece, but The Martian is an entertaining, weird mix of science and laughs that somehow works well without the need for predictable blockbuster cliches.",Tariq S,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 02, 2015",Tariq S,/user/id/844583203,RT,844583203,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1374687683/picture,The Martian

4.0,"I really enjoyed this movie & have no problems telling people to see it. Overall, it is phenomenally done--beautiful cinematography, good script, good acting. I really enjoyed the fact that there was so much humor in it, despite the seriousness of the plotline.  I kept getting flashbacks to ""Apollo 13,"" but since I really love that movie, I wasn't bothered by it.  While the plot relies on just about every cliche possible, it does so in a way that keeps you entertained & interested in what happens.  Again some issues with the way women are portrayed, especially women in command. I don't want to give spoilers, but really, did we need a Captain Janeway scene? Do male commanders take votes? And why did they only cast white women in the major women's roles? The male cast was fairly diverse, so there's no excuse for only casting white women.  Except for 2 roles that obviously had to be portrayed by Asian actors, the roles overall were gender & color-blind: Anyone could have played any of the roles in this movie. Performance-wise, Matt Damon does a good job, but not enough that he takes away from Johnny Depp's performance in ""Black Mass.""

3.5,"Matt Damon stranded alone in space is nothing new, in fact The Martian could have been a spin-off or a prequel story of Matt Damon's character in Interstellar and none would be the wiser. Jokes aside, The Martian gears up Matt Damon to continue his love-hate relationship with space but instead of being a cunning and cruel person willing to sacrifice anybody for his own survival, his character is that one of who's a brainiac, self-proclaimed space pirate, the best botanist of an entire planet, the man who colonized Mars and the accolades goes on. 
The Martian tells the story of Mark Watney, who was left in space-alone after a freak accident caused by a storm, he was then assumed to be dead by his space crew. How he survives and what is he willing to do to live another day is what makes the plot. This story is told from three angles, from Mark Watney's angle we get the first-hand experience of ""science-the-shit-out-of-stuff"" in order to increase the days before rescue comes for him, he'll do whatever it takes from rationing, creating his very own farm, journeying the landscapes of Mars and listening to terrible disco-pop music. This angle has a very upbeat tone about it as Watney keeps the atmosphere positive with his humorous nature and overwhelming energy to remain hopeful. No matter the triumphs and trials faced, he may feel like giving up but the next minute he's up to some crazy whiz-thinking to solve the problem and that's basically how the pacing of The Martian feels like. It's a gigantic problem solving puzzle that you have to fix part by part as you reach the solution. 
On the planet Earth side, we have politics determining the fate of the sole human being in Mars. Things get technical as the top executives of NASA try to chunk out solutions and ideas consecutively bringing in human drama that was lacking on Mars. The cast is extremely diverse and it feels realistic with multiple nationals involved in determining Watney's outcome. Though at times, dramatic values triumphs the quality, for instance a sudden genius figuring out recalculation required for a space-ship to realign its trajectory feels almost too random. The constant ""I know how to solve it but I won't say it to build suspense"" pattern and other common tropes already done before in previous sci-fi movies rob the magic a little bit on the drama portion as you've probably gotten used to it. 
Finally, on the crew side, we get a mix of emotions involving Watney's team members on how they feel about leaving one of their buddies all alone in space, the question of following NASA protocols or to choose a rule-breaking solution for Watney, becomes the crew's challenge. Despite this being a movie about one man staying solo in Mars, the movie shares the screen time with its large cast and makes sure everyone gets their screen time and punchlines. Technically the movie is a marvel to gaze at with its fantastic use of visual effects, Ridley Scott scores high with CGI and he's worked his magic once again, beautiful landscape shots are expected and he delivers. 
The movie itself is well executed with a solid pacing but it lacks the momentum in key portions especially during the transition between the three aforementioned story-telling perspectives. Sometimes it start on a high note and moves on to a dramatic debate followed by some dull conversation returning back to some bigger moments, the events that surround Matt Damon's is what gives the movie the exhilarating and thrilling push away from the other standard events. There are moments where you are hoping that the story switches its angle back to Matt Damon but it often doesn't and that takes a toll with a little draggy moments. After watching movies like Gravity, Interstellar and 127 Hours, one gets a little used to certain form of story-telling mechanics and struggled faced by the lead character, Ridley Scott does not try to bring anything new to the table or does he put his own touch into this adaptation. There are times you are rooting for Matt Damon's survival and there are parts where predictability sets in, scratching away the fun factor as you start guessing the end of a problem before the character can come up with it. The balance between predictability and the unknown is a constant fight in this show and as the movie continue to progress towards the end, ""predictability"" starts to overweigh the ""unknown"".

Overall, The Martian is another great sci-fi entry with strong performances, good comedy, and a likeable lead character. It does not shake-up the sci-fi formula much with mind-blowing plot twists and such but it plays to its core strength and ensures a top-class movie that can be easily enjoyed if you're able to accept it as it's very own species or you'll be entertained just enough with a blaring reminder of how other movie's elements play part in this one instead of it being a beast of its own.",Niro S,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 02, 2015",Niro S,/user/id/906849195,RT,906849195,,The Martian

4.0,"That moment when they are talking about the Council of Elrond, with Sean Bean sitting in the room xD Don't worry, he did not die, only fired! 

(The following review is written as if I have not read the book, which I have)

RIDLEY SCOTT IS BACK. Yes sir. I will not go into the visuals or cinematography because they are always perfect for his films, even if the films themselves suck. 
This is about the story. How one man is stuck alone on the planet and people come together to root for him and save him. It's scientists going beyond political barriers and overcoming any challenge to save this one guy stuck on Mars, who again, could not have survived without his will and wits!
The scenes with Damon actually feel like you are alone on Mars. You understand how he is coping with the help of humor to keep himself going, his frustration when things go south, you want him to survive! 
While people on Earth are running against time trying to do their best. And not everything go their way either and you are not sure whether they can save him. 
Meanwhile the crew that left him behind is dealing with the guilt as helpless spectators. 

You may think it might become a drag while watching one person alone on a planet and remind too much of Gravity, or even Interstellar with a similar cast, but the film never goes there. The scenes switch perfectly between Earth and Mars. All the characters are introduced developed at the right pace and serve the story well. The story keeps us engaged without overloading us with scientific jargon, rather tries to simplify everything possible for a non-science person to understand.

Perhaps one of the top 3 of the year (come The Revenant, Star Wars). Few parts could have gone faster, Matt Damon given more screen time and show more of the things he is doing for over 400 SOLS, but Im nitpicking now. 

Will re-watch this one :)

5.0,"The Martian takes places roughly a decade or two in the future of present day and centers around Mark Watney (Matt Damon), a botanist and astronaut who's part of Ares 3, the third crewed mission to Mars. While out collecting samples from the Martian surface, a sudden storm overtakes the crew, and with Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) convinced that Watney's been killed by falling debris, the crew leaves the planet and begins the journey back to Earth. Miraculously Watney is still alive, stranded alone on the surface of the Red Planet, and with a limited number of rations and four years to go before Ares 4 returns to Mars, he's got to figure out how to survive and get in touch with NASA.

Let me say this first, Matt Damon, you are awesome. Second, this film is brilliantly written. I read the book, and I was very worried about how they will get a lot of the details in the film without leaving holes or building a four hour run time. The filmmakers solution? Skip most of the fine details from the book, and keep the main story and plot in...but it works! This film is brilliantly written, splitting visual story telling and dialogue perfectly, not over saturating in any way. Its really a story split in two and sewn together in a way that makes this story riveting and a must watch ( I feel like I did when Interstellar (2014) came out, needing to see it multiple times.) One side of the story is Mark Watney's lonely, desolate and isolated struggle to make his 31 day habitat last four years until the Ares 4 mission lands on Mars, and get communications up with NASA - who thinks he is dead. The other side of the story is NASA's struggle with public relations and once they find out Watney is alive, their struggle to get him supplies and back to Earth alive. It is not heavy on scientific lingo like Interstellar is, but we still get a sense of intellectual brilliance within the characters and the whole film feels raw, real and entirely believable.

In a spark of motivated madness, Watney is able to grow Potatoes, make Oxygen and water and keep power up in the HAB through grueling work and spirit. Every time Mars throws him a curve ball, he figures it out. The most inspiring thing about the character of Mark Watney is his will to live and his unbreakable wit and positive attitude. through the entire ordeal. The filmmakers do a wonderful job of telling Watney's side of the story by  telling it through video diaries (much like the book), GoPro cameras attached to Watney's suit and traditional film making. Watney's sense of humor is one of the films brightest highlights next to the intense action sequences and gripping races against the clock. The landscapes in this film are breathtaking, unknowingly tricking you into thinking they really are on Mars. The sense of emotion in Watney, and his crew mates along with NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and his team are very present and deep. The stress to ""Bring him home"" is visible in even the background characters.

The Martian is a journey that is well worth the price of admission and then some. Ridley Scott can easily add this film to the 'Classic's' section of his portfolio. This is a film that is well done in 3D, but I imagine will be just as breath taking on regular cinema screens. Ridley Scott has made this film his own and gave it the 'Ridley Scott touch' that made some of his previous films what they are today with his eccentric way of building suspense and polished style of story telling. Damon is at the top of his career. Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan are all absolutely amazing in this tale of space travel and heart throbbing suspense.",Kyle P,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 02, 2015",Kyle P,/user/id/963525609,RT,963525609,,The Martian

4.0,"Despite its name, The Martian is a decidedly human drama.  Less about the perils of space than human ingenuity in the face of imminent peril (give or take a few SOL days), it succeeds in creating tension not only among various character in the film, but between Damon and the alien landscape he must endure.

I will say the climax of the movie was handled well and generated that edge of your seat feeling I wanted to see in other parts of the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film.

4.5,"It's another beautiful day on Mars, our closest planetary neighbor. As far as the eye can see stretches a reddish landscape reminiscent of Monument Valley in the great Westerns of John Ford. Given how science-fiction films supplanted the Western almost 40 years ago, with the release of ""Star Wars"" (a process that Western author John Jakes eloquently describes in his introduction to the anthology ""A Century of Great Western Stories""), there is something plaintively beautiful about these vistas. As the film progresses, our lone hero stranded in a hostile environment, riding through the dusty desert in his dune-buggy rover, the elegiac power of the images stems from this simultaneous invocation of past and future, combined.

Who is this man, lost on the 4th rock from the sun? It's Mark Watney, played with wry humor and physical grit by Matt Damon (""The Bourne Identity""). As the film opens, he and the other members of his six-person interplanetary crew are on ""sol 18"" of a planned month-long stay on Mars (a sol is a Mars solar day, 3% shorter than an Earth day). Into the raw majesty of their work site comes a sudden violent dust storm, and their commander calls to abort the mission, lest their MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) tip over, leaving them with no way to reach their orbiting spaceship for the return journey. As they make their way through the whirling clouds of particulate matter, a loose satellite disc strikes Watney, pierces his EVA suit and sends him spiraling into the dark. Search as they might, his colleagues can't find him, and with the MAV about to topple and Watney's on-suit vital-sign reader registering a zero, they leave the surface, abandoning what they think is Watney's corpse.

But he is not dead, and once the storm passes, he regains consciousness and makes his way back to the Hab (or Habitat Station). In a gruesome scene of self-stitching, Watney is able to clean and close the wound in his side. That's all good, but it doesn't take long for him to realize that, alive though he may be, he's alone on a planet 54.6 million kilometers from Earth, with limited rations and no way of communicating with NASA. Fortunately, he's a man of great scientific ingenuity (as we would hope an astronaut would be). As he says in the video log he keeps, he's going to have to ""science the sh** out of this."" And that he does.

Based on the bestselling book of the same title by Andy Weir, the movie is a brisk adaptation (even at 140 minutes, which go by quickly) of what was already a brisk novel. The screenplay is by Drew Goddard, the showrunner of Netflix's ""Daredevil"" (and one of the credited writers on ""World War Z""), and it doesn't waste a lot of time with elements that don't advance the narrative. This is a classic ""man with a problem"" story, and since that problem is of rather epic proportions, in a world we haven't seen before, every physical detail feels fresh. Directed by Ridley Scott - whose 1979 ""Alien"" is still one of the best films about space exploration to date - the movie is a marvel of an action thriller in which there isn't a whole lot of action. There are the occasional explosions, and a final sequence worthy of the best parts of Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity,"" but the real ""action"" - and real hero of the film - is the science. It's wonderful to see a movie in which nerds are celebrated.

Watney may be far from home, but he is not, ultimately, alone. Once NASA figures out he is alive, they get on the case, sometimes effectively, sometimes not. Though it may be mostly Damon's movie, it's also a nice ensemble piece, as we cut back and forth between Watney, the folks on Earth working to save him, and the crew on their way back from Mars. Not only does the film celebrate scientists, it also celebrates gender and racial diversity (as much as a Hollywood film can), even making a few changes to the source text to allow the mission commander played by Jessica Chastain (""Interstellar"") her own heroic moment. Other noteworthy performances include Chiwetel Ejiofor (""12 Years a Slave""), Michael Peña (""Ant-Man""), Kate Mara (""Fantastic Four""), Donald Glover (""Magic Mike XXL"") and Jeff Daniels (""The Newsroom""), among others. The dramatic stakes are high, as is the tension, but the film never loses site of the fact that it is here to entertain, and that it does, marvelously. Even if - in strictly narrative terms - no one goes through great character development, there is more than enough conflict and resolution to satisfy even the strictest adherents of Aristotelian three-act structure.

It's nice to see Ridley Scott in such fine creative fettle once more. After the one-two miserable punch of ""The Counselor"" and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" I was getting worried. Shooting in 3D - a format not strictly necessary for this story, but one that adds to the majesty of the images - he has created a visually stunning work that marries science and fiction in the best possible way. A lot of reviewers have already expressed the hope that the film could reinvigorate interest in space exploration. Here's hoping.",Christopher Llewellyn R,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 02, 2015",Christopher Llewellyn R,/user/id/791473372,RT,791473372,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/557636401/picture,The Martian

4.0,"'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued?

It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Peña, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s).

However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book & a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments.

4.0,"I'm generally not a big fan of Ridley Scott.  His films look wonderful, but he has a marked tendency to sacrifice character and plot in favour of production design.  Even a magnificent film like ""Blade Runner"" suffers from numerous plot incoherencies because he just doesn't seem to care about a film making sense as much as it looking immaculate.  Sometimes this tendency works in his favour though, and this film is a pretty clear example.  This film has a very simple and straightforward plot, and to really succeed it needs to make you believe in all the technical details.  In Scott's hands, it really does.  It's an immaculately constructed slice of big, mainstream entertainment, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Richard D,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 02, 2015",Richard D,/user/id/849167683,RT,849167683,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1393965328/picture,The Martian

3.0,"It's OKAY.  It's basically the love child of Cast Away and Apollo 13, only on Mars.  It has all the cliches of both, including my favourite piece of unimaginative film dialogue where someone says, ""In English, please?"" after a scientist explains something in an overly complicated manner.  It plays out exactly as you'd expect, there's no surprises or plot twists, it's very straight and narrow and quite frankly I feel like I've seen this film about ten times before.  

Also, the tone is all over the place.  It tries to be a serious disaster film one minute, then switches to Matt Damon and the guys at NASA cracking wise ones at each other the next.  I'm not saying you can't have humour in movies like this but use it in the right places, because when everybody is taking the piss I lost any sort of investment in the seriousness of the protagonist's situation. That's just me though. 

Good things, Matt Damon and the cast in general.  Although there are a few characters that I feel could have been written out completely, the actors do a good job with what they're given.  Mars feels very real, and I'd say that this is the best depiction of the planet in any film I've seen.  All the science stuff was interesting, I can't believe I was so interested in some guy trying to grow potatoes, but I was.  I like how Damon had to constantly improvise in order to survive, although he does play a scientific genius so he solved very serious problems relatively easily, but I can forgive that.  

Overall; it has enjoyable themes and moments, and Matt Damon carries it well, but I've seen it all before in different skins.

4.0,"Ridley Scott and science fiction go together like strawberries and cream. They are made for each other. Some of Scott's greatest work has been in the sci-fi realm: Alien, Blade Runner and, arguably, Prometheus. His impressive form within the genre continues with The Martian, a surprisingly comedic adventure that is so meticulous and intelligent you would be forgiven for thinking it was science fact. Pitching its tent somewhere between a less serious Interstellar and a more plot-driven Gravity, this interplanetary saga follows Matt Damon's stranded astronaut as he MacGuyver's his way to survival on the red planet. Damon's portrayal of the never-say-die genius botanist is tremendous, unexpectedly delivering one of the funniest performances on his CV whilst still bringing the dramatic heft. It's a small shame then, that we spend a fair chunk of our time away from Mars, either back on Earth with NASA execs, engineers and astrophysicists figuring out how to rescue their man or in outer space with the guilt-racked crew that accidentally left him behind. Regardless of location, Drew Goddard's screenplay (based on Andy Weir's novel) is always clever and carefully balanced, with a light-hearted tone that works amazingly well considering the dire circumstances. In fact it's this consistent and edgy humour that sets The Martian apart from other similar sci-fi outings; some gags are so funny it could quite easily find a place on 'best comedies' lists at year end. Scott brings his usual visual flair too; the arid vistas of Mars are gorgeous, the outer space shots are conceptually intriguing and photo-realistically executed, whilst the wisely injected action scenes are thrilling, if not totally reinventing the wheel. And wow, what a cast. Damon is the deserving star of the film, but it doesn't hurt when Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig and Kate Mara are playing second fiddle. Don't be fooled by its jovial disposition and spirited 70s disco soundtrack, this is yet another successful Scott epic.",Troy C,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 02, 2015",Troy C,/user/id/901318118,RT,901318118,,The Martian

This film had me right from the start and kept hold of me all the way until the end...unlike Gravity from 2 years ago, which lost me midway by it's too implausible storyline. The Martian's storyline might seem implausible too, but it rang so much truer and realistic to me, and that's what made this story so compelling. I continually felt the emotion that Damon's character feels and expresses on screen. And that's probably one of the reasons I think this is Ridley Scott's best film since Black Hawk Down in 2001. He's in touch with emotion again. So many of his films of the last decade or so have lacked the depth of feeling that his best work has.

3.5,"Holy crap, Hollywood we have a problem... 

Another one that Ridley Scott manages to make appealing to the greater public and OVERSELLS the whole point of pondering about humanity. Do we really need to be reminded every 10 minutes about the importance of humanity? Whatever happened to the beauty of unspoken messages in cinema? Also, the recreation of Mars is way too iconic to what it could have looked like. For a film that depicts one person stranded on a deserted PLANET, it feels too crowded. Got a second of being alone at Mars? Heeey, let's fast forward the shit out of it. Sunsets on Mars, anyone? Not for me. Why don't we time-lapse it and in the meantime, let's add in some voice over just to make it more 'appealing to the general public'. Hey Scott, do not be afraid of silence, it will not hurt, we promise. As long as you keep telling a story, silence will not kill it; pace yourself!

Engineering. Where is the math? That's just plain rude. And no, writing numbers on walls  and making the characters say ""hexadecimal"" several times does not cut it.

Anyway, cinematography works quite well, but it is too iconic for my taste (landscape-wise), which takes some weight from the truly aesthetic shots. 

Acting. Matt Damon makes a pretty good space monkey. 

Directing. The perils, uncertainty, fear, psychological distress and several other physical or emotional factors are underused by Scott. So much potential, yet so sad to see Hollywood's money stamp all over the film instead of the rawness of space. The Ares program was all about mutiny and defending core values, why can't huge directors make the same? (Read more about The Man)

Other than that, it feels like... Jurassic Park, but with a lesser degree of complexity. It feels good to watch the film, you enjoy it deeply. It is very cool, but odd. It just feels like there is something missing. For Scott, it was his gut to actually step out of his comfort zone.


3D: Nah. Not worth the penny. Also, who knows how many divine creatures came up to Ridley Scott to dissuade him of filming in 3D, but I am happy about that. This works well on 3D, it is enjoyable, but nah, stick to 2D.

I can gladly say, ""The Martian"" is not only his best film in a very long time, but it is also one os 2015's best overall pictures. After presumed dead and left on Mars by his crew, botanist Mark Watney must use his scientific skills to savour/grow food to last him up to four years. Filled with unexpected humour, this film is able to balance a light-hearted tone while digging deep into the emotion when necessary. This film had me chuckling quite a bit, and I give full credit to Drew Goddard d Andy Weir who penned the script. This witty sic-fi rescue mission is also as intense as it needs to be, ramping up to the conclusion. From the visuals to the directing, from the writing to the cinematography, and from the acting to the believability of this film, it really is one of the biggest achievements of the year by far. I was enthralled from start to finish. Although I have to fault the film for ending a bit too abruptly, I can forgive that for being the only true thing to bother me. In the end, ""The Martian"" is a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Fantastic!",KJ P,False,True,False,False,4.5,"Oct 01, 2015",KJ P,/user/id/896976177,RT,896976177,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/733768972/picture,The Martian
4.0,"After the past two years with Gravity and Interstellar coming out, two of the greatest sci-films in history in my opinion, I was eagerly awaiting the next huge space sci-fi epic.  Along comes The Martian with one of the best ensembles of the year and a sci-fi genius in Ridley Scott directing.  A story about a man stranded on Mars after his crew assumed he was dead and you get Matt Damon to play the lead? Count me in.  The verdict?  I really liked The Martian.  It's really funny, highly entertaining, and beautiful to look at, but I wasn't blown away.

Matt Damon is more than worth the price of admission.  For most of the film, he has pretty much no one to act off of, which is something I think people are overlooking.  The ensemble back home and his crew on their way back carry a load of screen-time, but this is Matt Damon's movie.  Whether it's Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain, or Michael Pena, the cast is on top of their game.  I think where the film lacks is surprisingly its directing.  I know it's based on a book, but there were plenty of scenes that I wish lasted longer but were short and vice versa.  That's the case especially toward the end when I'm supposed to feel a rush of emotion, instead I felt letdown that I didn't get to see more of a scene.  But the film does a great job of bringing to life scenes that should seem boring and dry.  For example, all of the scientific centered exposition never feels overwhelming.  That can be contributed to Ridley Scott's directing and Matt Damon's likability as an actor.  That's one of the things The Martian does extremely well, it's really well paced in terms of entertainment level.  You don't feel the length.

So perhaps it's more of editing issues instead of Scott's  actual directing I had a problem with.  Another thing that let me down was how little Damon's crew was in the film.  That dynamic between all of them could have been explored whether it be flashbacks or just through the NASA message system.  Especially when you have people like Jessica Chastain, it just seemed like a bit of a missed opportunity.  No matter, The Martian still should most definitely be seen on the big screen.  The Mars scenes alone are visually breathtaking.  I don't know how much is green screen but I felt like I was on another planet.  In terms of the special effects and CG, iv'e seen better.  Again, we have been spoiled with space in film so I can acknowledge this film looks great.  It just doesn't hold a candle to Interstellar or Gravity.  But it's hard to pick apart this film.  There really isn't much wrong with it, it just didn't blow me away like it did for others in the film community.

+Damon's Oscar worthy performance

+Mars has never looked better

+Humor

+Ensemble

-Underused supporting crew though

-CG has been better

5.0,"The Martian is Ridley Scott back in top form, delivering a hilarious and scientific masterwork.  First off, let me say that Matt Damon's performance is perfect.  Damon completely embodies the character of Mark Whatney and brings every bit of his humor, optimism ans humanity to the role.  Its a peformance that only get better the farther into the movie you get, and its the reason we want to see this make it out alive.  The rest of the cast also impressed me, especially the performances of Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain.  The script was brilliant, completely using science as its greatest asset.  I believed that a man could survive on Mars using nothing but science, and that is due to Scott's brilliant direction.  He makes Mars into a brilliant landscape, and  I had my jaw dropped in several scenes.  I also should note this is an incredibly tense film, and I was biting my nails throughout.  The Martian is one of my favorite films of 2015.  It was a sensational experience thanks to a great script, amazing visuals and Ridley Scott's best direction in several years.

5.0,"So this is how it feels when you watch a Ridley Scott's film on a theatre, uh? I know the director since Gladiator, Imissed Prometheus, Robin Hood etc, now I had the chance to watch his newest film and this is THE MARTIAN.
Staring Matt Damon as Mark Watney, a mission is sent to Mars but a storm forces the crew to abort the mission and leave, during the evacuation Mark is enjured and pressumed dead, the rest of the crew leaves, but Mark survived and is abandoned in the planet, with onle a few food to survive moonths, so he manages a way to survive on the planet while he waits a rescue mission, which may take four years. During his stay at the planet he farms some food, manages to ""create"" water and finds a way to have some fun, While back on Earth the NASA receives a message from Mark to help him, they have difficulties to find a way to rescue him and his crew does not know that he is alive.
The film portrays with excellency how the human being reacts on this situations, the will to survive or to accept that your moment has come, and how humanity joins on situations of great size. Matt Damon is fanatastic on this film, human and funny. Also the film teach a little about astrophysics. There's something that I really enjoyed about the film and it was the cinematography on Mars, it really feels and looks like the planet and the 3D really helps to give a better view to it also gives a best sensation of environment and never distratcs the audiences, it was well used.

It's super faithful to the wonderful book, and as far as I can tell (which isn't a lot) it got ALL of the science (barring the storm at the very beginning) right (albeit neglecting to explain some of it - so while people who know a little a bit Mars or have read the book would be perfectly in on the details while people who aren't would probably not understand one or two key things). 
Damon is a wonderful Watney despite my original skepticism of the casting, and remains true to the spirit of the protagonist and the wide range of emotions he displays throughout the story.
The scenery is breathtaking, the technology is believable (as it was in the novel - nothing we don't already actually have in one form or another), and the movie is basically a love letter to science in general and space science specifically.

After a terrible storm on a Mars causes a bunch of NASA Astronauts to abort there mission and head home but as the storm hits big team member Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is thought to have died and is left all alone on the red Planet with very little to keep him alive and a possible wait of 4 years to be rescued and only old Happy Days Episodes and disco music to keep him company! 
Nothing will beat Alien for his space masterpiece, and though I was not hugely blow away by it's prequel Prometheus it still was a fantastic looking film but Ridley's 3rd trip into space is very different from his previous two. 
Scott is one of those directors who defiantly knows how to make powerful films with depth and content but he is knot really know for just having fun with a film.
Not since Matchstick Men has Scott put as much comedy and funny moments into a film yet still staying grounded in the seriousness of the situation at hand, something that has been fairly absent from recent space films.
Matt Damon is hugely enjoyable as our Stranded Potato loving Space Botanist who's video logs back to NASA keeps the comedy of his frustration being stuck on Mars with only old Happy Days Episodes and bad disco music to keep him going mad & all the other supporting cast are enjoyable too.  
The film dose have some flaws, at 141 minutes it is a little long and where some scenes could have been dropped completely, some scenes could have been explored a lot deeper.
Though the films ending is getting Watney off the planet is fantastic the films conclusion feels slightly under developed that leaves a few unanswered questions and the build up of the rest of the world world eager to see if he will be rescued or not feels a little overblown with thousands on the street like new years eve waiting to get confirmation of his rescue on huge set up TV screens is a bit much.

5.0,"This is a brilliant adaptation of a great book. It's funny, dramatic and uplifting all at the same time.  It's no wonder NASA has embraced this film. It's a vision for what NASA's future should be.  Matt Damon has managed to take the Mark Watney character you grew to love in the pages of the book and bring him to life on the big screen. All of the acting is good, but Damon carries the biggest burden and does so with ease.   Ridley Scott and the entire crew did a remarkable job bring the audience to the surface of Mars. It is a visually spectacular film and 3D viewing is highly recommended.  I think making a realistic looking martian setting is very hard to do in an era when you can look at new real pictures from Mars on a daily basis.  They pulled it off brilliantly.  I think some might be afraid the movie will be too geeky or delve into too much science.  It doesn't.  I'm a fan of science and it had just enough to satisfy me without going into the detail the book does.  The mix of humor and drama punctuated with disco music is just right.

5.0,"The Martian is directed by the great Ridley Scott who happens to be one of my favourite directors and stars Matt Damon,Chiwetel Ejiofor,Michael pena,Kate mara,Kristen Wigg,Jessica Chastain,Sebastian Stan,Donald Glover among many others. The Martian tells the story of Astronaut Mark Watney(Matt Damon) who gets stranded on Mars after being left behind by his crew who assumes he dies in a storm. The Martian is a love letter to science and its absolutely incredible to watch Ridley Scott knock it out of the park once again after the counsellor and exodus. Matt Damon is simply excellent in this role as he is extremely charismatic and we root for him throughout the film due to his character's continued optimism even when things go to shit. His sense of optimism provides some extremely funny moments throughout the film. The whole cast is great here and its awesome watching so many likeable actors working together in one movie. The science in the film feels extremely believable and if I didn't know that it was based on a book, I might have thought that the movie is based on real life events that happened. The movie has a runtime of 2h 14mins and it moves by extremely quickly and there is not a single dull moment or unnecessary scene in the entire film. Props to Drew Goddard for writing such a thrilling and funny script. The movie is shot beautifully and Mars looks absolutely gorgeous. I really have no issues with the film and its definitely one of my favourite films of 2015. The Martian is such an optimistic and pro science film with its focus on problem solving.

Matt Damon did a good job surrounded by a mediocre cast who likely got their parts because of their fame rather than their suitability for the role in question. The acting is terrible overall...likely in part to a shitty screenplay that didn't do the book justice - zero character development. They dumbed too many things down to accommodate the common denominator, instead of staying true to the nature of the story.

5.0,"Thank you, Ridley Scott for making this fantastic film. I am obviously too young to relate to moon landing in 1969, but I kinda imagine this is the kind of feeling people had. Somehow, in a brief moment, there is this reasonable unity across human race. This kind of experience that I always wanted. The Martian, after some consideration, is the closest feeling I can get to that experience. It is something truly precious.
Matt Damon is perfect for Mark Watney. He is a spearhead optimist. This kind of character is vital to how The Martian is told. It colors the fun in the seriousness.  Aside from its clever choice of music, The Martian has this intricate script to tie everything together, and it is more than enjoyable.

5.0,"The Martian starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott is based on the novel by Andy Weir and tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut and botanist who is left stranded on Mars after he is presumed dead after being hit with some debris during a fierce storm. The story revolves around Mark's survival and the plan on Earth to get him back home.

The Martian truly is a spectacular film and a contender for my film of the year (although I'm hoping Star Wars takes that mantle).  Visually it's stunning and is a film that was made for the big screen.  Ridley Scott has managed to capture the breadth and isolation of  the surface of the planet perfectly in which appears to be a very real and tangible environment i.e there doesn't appear to have been a great deal of CGI used, if it has it's very well done.

The performances are first class and not just from Damon whose physical performance is matched by his emotional one as his body changes miraculously during the course of the film and you also become attached to his character and will him to succeed.  The supporting cast is excellent with Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor (Twelve Years a Slave), Jessica Chastain (Interstellar) playing along side a strangely comedic cast of  Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids), Donald Glover (30 Rock) and Michael Peña who shone in the recent Marvel movie Ant-Man.  However these comedians are mostly playing it straight but ironically the power of the film is in it's use of comedy and for a film about a guy stranded in space there is a huge amount of comic relief which puts a lot of so called current day comedies to shame, and easily passes the Mark Kermodian 6 laugh test.  For fans of disco music the soundtrack is brilliant.

Due to the level of performances, The Martian manages to do what so many movies fail to do and that's rouse an emotional response.  It's hard to believe that the director that gave us Alien and the tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"" could give us the best space feel good movie I've ever seen.  The sense of euphoria I got whilst watching the film was unbelievable and I would have punched the air in elation at certain points in the film if that was a) socially acceptable and b) not a violation of the cinema code of conduct (there is a cinema code of conduct, if you're not aware of it look it up.  And if you're not aware of it, you might not want to come cinema with me).

4.5,"The Martian excelled at telling a gripping story with amazingly real characters, many intense edge of seat sequences all the way through and quite a bit of humour that also made the film surprisingly really funny. This film marks the return for legendary director Ridley Scott, who after a few misses has created yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of his best. Ridley Scott is known to be a master at making his films visually incredible and that is no different in this film, the wide shots in space are amazing and Mars looks so real that you wonder how they actually got to Mars to film this. This may just be the best space film to come out in the last few years, even though i loved Interstellar this may just be a step above and a little more polished. This film managed to still remain very smart whilst also dropping a lot of the complex science talk that weighted down Interstellar, making it very easy to follow (Yes i understand this film doesn't have interstellar travel to worry about) 

What was amazing is how they managed to tell a very smart and coherent story about one man spending many years on a deserted planet in 2 hours and 20 minutes without feeling like too much time was skipped. From start to finish you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next, you are so engaged in what is happening right now that you don't even think about what's going to happen next and that is just an example of great storytelling. What i also thought was a great element in the film was that it was not only about one mans survival but also about the struggles of the people back on Earth who have to figure out a way to retrieve him. And this allowed for the film to constantly swap back and forth between the two locations allowing you to see how everyone reacts at each moment of the film. And it felt very natural unlike some of the transitions between Earth and space in Interstellar feeling rushed and unconnected. 

When you have almost the entire film featuring one man on screen you must have an incredible talent who can capture the audience's attention and keep them entertained the whole time. And Matt Damon manages to accomplish that so perfectly i can;t imagine anyone else doing a better job as astronaut Mark Watney. This is by far one of the best performances of his career and he has done a lot of amazing stuff in the past. He manages to carry the film on his shoulders with ease and was so fun to watch. He is such a world class talent to be able to portray this fictional character in a way that made me at many times think that i was watching some kind of true story, he captured all of the emotion and struggles this guy was going through so well, and just added layers to his character. Not only was this a serious and at times emotional film but it was also hilarious and much of those comedic elements came from Matt Damon. The quick one liners all hit and made the entire full theatre laugh every time. 

But he did not do it alone, Damon was accompanied by one of the most incredibly talented supporting casts of the year and they only add to the enjoyment of the film. Heres some of the supporting cast to give you an idea; Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kate Mara.... WOW thats big. And even more impressive is that every character seemed useful and wasn't just thrown in there for a meaningless cameo, they all had an important part to play at some point in the film and they all deliver on their performances. They add to the story, the emotion, the humour and were all great additions to the film. And seeing Kate Mara act in this film confirms to me that she was not part of the problems that sunk Fant4stic.

And i thought space could not get any more intense than it did in Gravity and Interstellar. But this film delivers on a level above those films, there were countless moments where i was frozen still due to the anticipation of what may happen next, featuring sweaty palms and all that. And these moments weren't just quick 3 minutes of intense dramatic action, it had me stunned for like at least 15 minutes at a time multiple times and had me in awe, holding my breath, and on the edge of my seat...... it was truly amazing. 

So in the end this was a very smart, humorous, intense and entertaining adventure full of insane dramatic action, and emotion. Great characters, a compelling adapted script and beautiful shots makes this another masterpiece in the space film genre. - 9.2",Stephen P,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Oct 01, 2015",Stephen P,/user/id/881713764,RT,881713764,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000134211968/picture,The Martian

The film moves along at a brisk pace, however, the film steadily builds the characters throughout and whilst the main focus is on Mark Watney, Scott manages to keep a large ensemble engaging and interesting. The cast do a fine job.
The scenes on Mars are very nicely shot, with good effects that avoid it feeling like a movie Mars rather than a real one. 
There is a lot of humour in the movie, but it works, and one can't help but feel a slight influence from Guardians of the Galaxy here.

4.0,"I wasn't planning to see this.

I wanted to see ""Inside Out"" a second time in the cinema, but during my movie outing with my classmate, I decided to watch this instead upon noticing the rave reviews, and the fact that I'm already getting the DVD for ""Inside Out"".

In this film, which is directed by Ridley Scott and is based on a novel, a storm rages on Mars, forcing an astronaut crew (cast members include Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara) to abort a mission there. When they are retreating, astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is hit by debris and is lost. The team leaves Watney behind on Mars and he is presumed dead. He, however, survives, using his skills as a botanist and the supplies left behind on Mars. When NASA discovers that he is in fact, alive, they decide to rescue him as soon as possible. Will Watney be brought back home?

To my surprise, I enjoyed this film a lot. Damon's portaryal as Watney is brilliant, and we were kept in suspense, rooting for him to survive and return to Earth. We feel his pain when things go wrong. The supporting cast were great too, particularly Chastain's character. The movie is not gloomy throughout, as there are several funny moments that I didn't expect. It reminds me of the 2013 film ""Gravity"", another movie that involves an astronaut trying to return back to Earth (it won several Oscar awards).

In conclusion, ""The Martian"" is a great survival movie even though it was a bit draggy at parts. I'm going to give this a strong 8 out of 10 and a recommendation. If you like science-fiction movies such as ""Gravity"", then this is for you.

5.0,"When Ridley Scott returned to science fiction thirty years later for only the third time, after delivering two of THE towering masterpieces of the genre (Blade Runner and Alien of course) it was a really big deal, huge anticipation was built   especially since we were getting a return of sorts to the Alien franchise, Prometheus of course was a bizarre let down of course, it was incredibly well crafted, technically amazing and occasionally fascinating but ultimately an empty, confused mess. Three years later, Scott almost seems to be saying, ""oops, sorry here's that film you wanted"", applying to the technical mastery and cinematic craftsmanship a great script (by Cabin In The Woods/Cloverfield genius Drew Goddard) and a storytelling deftness not seen from the director in well over a decade. The Martian is an instant classic of sci-fi, essentially Robinson Crusoe in space, it sees Matt Damon's astronaut/botanist Mark Watney stranded, presumed dead, on mars, with years before a rescue mission can make it to him he has to uber Macgyver what has been left behind to stretch out his survival chances. This is such a hugely entertaining film, it's bigger and more vast in scope than you think, flitting effortlessly and grippingly between Watney on mars, his crew travelling back to earth and mission control trying anything they can, no matter how nuts, to get him home. The other suprise is just how funny this film is, it's an actual feelgood sci-fi, survival adventure, much of this is down to Damon himself, whose Mark Watney is a refreshingly piss taking, sarcastic, cheeky optimist. There's a sense of positivity to this film that is lovely, so many space set movies are ever so dour and grim, this is about the attitude of ""well im clearly gonna die here, but i dont want to, so i've got to do whatever i can to live"", it's a moving tribute to the resilience of the human spirit and science itself, it shows that science, frankly, can be fucking great. It feels like a film to inspire future discoverers, travelers, scientists, it's a call to not abandon the space race, to keep striving for ways of getting out there and bettering our race, our world and our future, to search and discover whats next, whats seemingly beyond our reach, rather than relegating ourselves to a single rock, with our heads down for the rest of our existence.",Bill M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 01, 2015",Bill M,/user/id/790135380,RT,790135380,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/584292188/picture,The Martian

3.5,"A cross between Castaway and Gravity, although not as good as either of them. It's predictable and long with woven in American values of 'working hard' and 'not leaving a man behind' which the rest of the world finds corny. I expect better from Ridley Scott.

4.0,"It's good in aspect of the internal struggle you get with a man that's trapped on a planet by himself. He's trying to survive with dwindling supplies and many days before people can get to him. The movie delivers this perfectly and Ridley Scott produces profound suspense throughout the film. 
Though the movie isn't all that great or special in anyway. If you loved gravity then you'll love this. It has the same sorry pretty much. ""Gravity but on Mars"". I've coined the phrase. 
Though if you want deeper story then you won't find it here. It does do a better job on the individual aspect of someone trying to survive and this drives it past Gravity in my opinion. However this is also really far fetched compared to Gravity. The ending really shows it. It felt gimmicky and switched the tone in the movie. It was kind of off putting and felt unnecessary. This also stretched the run time but with for no reason. 
Though the practical effects in this movie were off the chart. Though they did get help from NASA (which is the biggest product placement in the movie). Ridley did a great job creating Eartth to look like Mars and made us feel confide in that little pod Matt's character lived in. It was a relief and never felt like it was a movie or movie set, as a lot of movies tend to fail (I'm looking at you scorched trials). 
The acting is where it shines though. Matt did a great job of giving info to us as we didn't know what was happening. The log which was just exposition that helped drive the movie. Damon delievers in a way so we don't think he's just giving the audience information. Scott masters this party perfectly and Damon allows use to get information without feeling overthrown with dialogue. Damon also shows us the struggle of living without any human content through his acting. However, I do wish Scott would have focused more on a mental breakdown someone would have if they went though this. 
It also feels like a roller coaster at times with the up and down pacing. I there's a sense that Scott dint know what was the most important parts so he left them out and then would include plot developments that slowed the movie. 
Overall I really did enjoy the movie though. It wa a fantastic adventure that showed Damon's true talent and seems to be a come back in Scott's career. Surprising we get two comeback movies a month from each other. I would give the Martain two thumbs up but don't go in thinking its some amazing plot. 8.5/10",Brendan S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Oct 01, 2015",Brendan S,/user/id/915019333,RT,915019333,,The Martian

4.5,"I love this new trend of harder sci-fi movies coming out in the fall of each year. I can enjoy a Star Wars type sci-fi film, but it had gotten out of hand, and I really want to see some sci-fi based on some legit science.  We've had three years in a row with critically and financially successful films of this kind, and I hope the trend continues for years to come.  The whole cast is great in this, but MAtt Dmon really is prefect as a botanist trapped on Mars after an accident during a storm has his crew and NASA presuming him to be dead.  He must use his wits to survive on a Planet that can't sustain human life or even grow food...and must figure out a way to do it for four years when the next mission should land there.

4.0,"#TheMartian/#MisionRescate es la película No. 23 en la prolífica carrera de Ridley Scott. Esta basada en la novela de Andy Weir. Sin ser una de las obras mas personales del reconocido director británico, #TheMartian es tal vez la segunda cinta (despues de Matchstick Men) en utilizar el humor como acelerador de una trama que sin este recurso cansaria rapidamente al espectador. 2 horas de duración enfocadas en el astronauta Mark Watney (Matt Damon) abandonado en Marte, se convierten en una bitacora personal en donde la música juega un papel indispensable para las secuencias en donde Watney explica con lujo de detalles sus tareas de supervivencia en el inhóspito planeta rojo. De la trilogia de filmes sobre exploración espacial e introspección personal iniciada con Gravedad (Alfonso Cuarón-2013), seguida por Interstellar (Christopher Nolan-2014) y fnalizada con la visión de Ridley Scott sobre el tema, creo que esta última será la mas atractiva para el público general.

Outer Space sequences are incredible and well worth watching in 3D, they are the new current level that everyone will try to beat.

4.5,"The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and is written by Drew Goddard. It stars: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastian, Chiwetel Ejiofor and many others. This movie is about a team of astronauts who are on mars, a storm hits so they decide that they should leave. But whilst they're attempting to leave, Matt Damon gets hit by debris and his crew believe that he is dead. And the rest of the movie is him trying to survive on mars. The movie has a fantastic script, it is very funny. The characters are all very funny and very realistic. Apart from Jeff Daniels' character, who is very serious and incredibly cliche. The movie also has some fantastic acting from Matt Damon, probably one of his best performances. Incredibly raw and also very interesting. The soundtrack and score are also great, they perfectly match what is happening on screen. CGI is used for a short amount of time, but it is used incredibly well when it is needed to be used. The set design is also great, the ship and the base on mars look fantastic, and so does the space suit. Scenes set on earth and in the space ship with the crew towards the end of the movie get slightly tiresome, but are still not boring. One issue i had was that you never see Matt Damons character turn even a little bit crazy, i mean he's on his own on a planet for a substantial amount of time and he doesn't change at all, apart from a physical change.

It's no secret that I found Scott's movies to have been quite disappointing over the past fifteen years or so, ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" ""Body Of Lies,"" ""Robin Hood,"" ""Prometheus"" for example - they just existed - they didn't leave a mark nor carry a lot of weight. But I had hope that the director who gave us such classics as ""Alien,"" and ""Blade Runner"" would return to his form and I find that in THE MARTIAN.

Based on Andy Weir's outstanding debut novel and adapted by Drew Goddard (""Cloverfield,"" ""Cabin In The Woods"") Oscar winner Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who's a member of the NASA crew that explores the planet Mars. A storm forces them to leave their mission but a debris hits Watney and he's presumed dead as his fellow crew members leave him behind. But surprise! Wanted survives, he must now figure out how to continue to survive on that desolate planet where nothing grows and his food supplies are dwindling while at the same time figure out how to make contact with NASA. Mark Watney relies on his wit, his botany skills, his courage and his strong determination to get through each day as NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home.

What's funny about this is that a couple of years ago, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" was also the best movie of that year in my book, and last year, Matt Damon played a character in Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" that somewhat went through a similar situation as his ""The Martian"" character, Mark Watney although they're not exact copy. But the point is, THE MARTIAN, at the heart of it, is a survival movie, just like any other survival movies you've seen about one person stranded on some island or some deserted place. What makes THE MARTIAN unique is that it's unlike any other sci-fi movies, mostly because author Andy Weir impressively did his best to make every aspect and every element of this film as accurate as possible. The extensive research is remarkable. In addition to that, the film feels like a series of solving math problem, one after another. Every time there's a glimmer of hope, a problem comes along and complicates the situation again, but it only pushes the characters to brainstorm, to think outside the box and reach out to other help.

THE MARTIAN is a monumental cinematic achievement. From the story to the performances to the production design to the VFX, to the editing to every little detail of technical standpoint, everything about this film embodies excellence. It gives us what ""Interstellar"" could not, because Nolan's movie meant well, but the concept unfortunately trumped its story whereas ""The Martian"" has them go hand-in-hand. And perhaps some audiences might view this movie as a bit political especially with the scenario of NASA getting assistance from China's space program, but I think anybody from any background could view that as basic morality, the things that we humans could accomplish if we were to focus on a common goal instead of making it be only about a space race. It's amazing that even some smart nerd in Pasadena could bring positive contribution or an idea to the table. The movie is about a collaboration of all these people just to bring one man home, so it's more or it's a much bigger picture than just about Matt Damon's Mark Watney. THE MARTIAN is epic in every sense of the word, it will make you applaud at the end, it deserves a standing ovation.

I hope THE MARTIAN would reignite today's generation's interest to once again dream big and look to the skies. Not everybody is going to be an astronaut or work for NASA's plan of someday putting a man on Mars, but personally, I think films like THE MARTIAN, stories such as this, solidify what I've always strongly believed to be true, science is sexy.

Now it's not better than Interstellar. That was just an incredible film. They are pretty different and there is a lot more to Interstellar than this. But that's not to say anything bad about The Martian because it was great. It's just a more straight-forward survival and rescue film (like Apollo 13 meets Castaway, two Tom Hanks films by the way :-P) than Interstellar and I tend to like more complex and over the top, heady, and cerebral plots.

5.0,"""What makes a movie Good to Great is simply add a dash of Bowie and the film just glows like a Fabulous transgender diamond"" 
- Reuben Goddard 

This is my favorite movie of the year. yeah Mad Max was absolutely incredible, but the Marian is easily one of the most satisfying science fiction dramadies I've ever seen. Yes a Dramady. It has incredibly suspenseful moments yet the human heart of the Main Character, excellently portrayed by Matt Damon, truly shines as he is determined to fight the odds of being stranded on Mars and use all his knowledge and determination to survive, as we see his struggle as he tries to find the funny side of this terrifying situation. I loved this film. Its so refreshing to see a film not linger on the negatives of a bad situation, but trying to focus on finding a funny side to it, and trying to not focus on all the bad.

4.0,"It's Castaway meets Apollo 13, with a few reminders of Interstellar thrown in.  Considering I enjoyed all three of those movies, it's no surprise that I enjoyed this as well.  I was completely engrossed -- at times I found myself thinking ""I wonder if that's how it really happened"" as if this was a true story, which I hope is a commentary on how effective the movie is (rather than how dumb I am).  I can't speak to how ""realistic"" it is from a scientific perspective (I assume they took some fairly significant liberties), but it worked for me.

4.5,"It's hard to think of all that many ""Rescue"" movies, and those I could name are almost always true stories.  Apollo 13 is the most obvious comparison here, with a little bit of Castaway thrown in for good measure (making it more of a survival/rescue movie than anything else).

It somehow retains the ""true story"" feel thanks in large part to the attention to detail on the use of existing technologies, good sensible problem-solving, and the ""video diary"" monologue format that Matt Damon finds himself spending the majority of the movie performing.

This is then not a ""disaster"" movie full of thrills and spills and action galore.  It's not Gravity.  It's also not your traditional sci-fi movie either, although there is a veritable bounty of both science, and fiction at play.  It's not Interstellar with all the bells and whistles and alien intervention.  What we find in The Martian, is grounded absolutely in reality and plausibility, which is key to getting that ""true story"" feel.  It deftly avoids bamboozling the audience with too much hard science, while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary dumbing down or exposition.  Instead, we get treated to some excellent problem solving of the basic chemistry and logic variety.  Computer nerds like myself will also be thrilled to see a respectful usage given to ASCII and Hexadecimal during one of the problem solving segments.

What you get here then, is a very engaging, thoroughly enjoyable, genuinely exciting, and good humoured movie that is suitable for all audiences.  Damon is excellent as the likeable and only slightly rougue-ish Mark Watney, and the supporting cast is a who's who of excellence.  The casting is about as perfect as perfect gets, and it pays off.

This film is ultimately a love letter to problem solving.  Intelligence as a survival tool is not something that often gets highlighted.  We've had plenty of wilderness movies with people surviving through guts and brawn, and physical skill - but never before have I seen someone surviving purely using textbooks, make-shift scientific equipment and improvisation of the technology around them.  This makes The Martian something rather special, and of particular appeal to the bookish and intellectual.

It's pleasing to see that Ridley Scott still has a few new tricks up his sleeve, and can still do grounded sci-fi when he wants to (don't mention Prometheus).  This movie is everything I wanted Interstellar to be (and would've been, if the original script had not been dumbed down and replaced with pseudo-science).  It's also a natural successor to the excellent and aforementioned Apollo 13, updated for modern audiences, sprinkled with a little future-tech, and crafted into a perfect story not constrained by ""true story"" limits.

This movie can and should be enjoyed by everyone.",Jonathan A,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 29, 2015",Jonathan A,/user/id/785000579,RT,785000579,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/571478474/picture,The Martian

4.5,"Saw this movie tonight.  I liked it a lot - but not quite as well as Interstellar.  The main reason was because the situations were ridiculously impossible to solve, the solutions equally ridiculous, but they didn't resort to any magical stuff like Interstellar.  I mean if you are going to go take my imagination to the edge you might as well bring in the fourth, fifth, or sixth dimensions and aliens too.  You bring the script that far out, why not?  Seriously, though, it was a good movie.  The story was good--however implausible--and they tried hard to respect the physics when they could, although I knew that Martian chat would turn into a Facebook affair even after the 12-minutes-to-and-from-Mars was given proper lip service.  ""R U there?""  - favorite line in their chats.  lol  Still watch this one if you like sci-fi.  It's a solid sci-fi flick talking about our favorite, most popular little hell hole in our insignificant solar neighborhood - Mars - but, more importantly, talking about people, which is really all that matters.

This was not a good part of the movie I particularly enjoyed. The sound effects were fantastic. Nice ending that made me smile, and the film sets were well made, too.

He acts in ways that we can relate to.  I sensed it as, ""yea I can see myself acting that way in times of those particular crises.""  The humor adds another fun dimension to the survival cause that Damon is fuels.  He is just good at engaging the viewers with a fun personality that makes it all feel so real.  Ridley Scott is just tremendous at film making.  He shows it here.  What also cannot be ignored is the performance from Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA.  He is tough, stern, and runs things by the book with a certain confidence.  I really thought he was tremendous.  Jessica Chastain continues to bolster her resume as one of the best actresses in Hollywood.  What keeps me from giving it a perfect 5 star rating is some of the cliche corny-ness that the film avoided for the most part, but shined through at certain moments.

2.0,"Matt Damon is left behind on Mars when the rest of the crew launch the homeward journey without him! Golly life's tough isn't it? But not for Watney (Damon), oh no! Desperation, worry, stress, loneliness rarely enter his mind, and being a genius he can make water (yes seriously), he can grow potatoes (amazing) and he even manages a minor operation on himself with no anaesthetic! That may well be picky of me, but seriously the redeeming features weren't really there.

For me it was slow paced and rather uneventful, bordering boring in places. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was more than what I got. Not a Martian (alien) in sight. Just a biog of a man who happens to be stranded on Mars, and he's rescue mission.

Luckily for him he has the human waste from the mission to grow potatoes, unfortunately for him they're soon destroyed.

For several months (almost a year I believe), he makes a traditional living with himself until he's finally contacted, then much later until NASA can actually get there. Decent music score. It had an interesting track selection. I didn't really feel as much of the ""outer space edge"" like I did during Gravity and Interstellar. This one I felt had more casual movie directing for its genre, but it had a good follow-along story and included some very neat visuals of the red planet itself and where it was filmed.

4.0,"After 30 years of being away from the world of science fiction, director Ridley Scott returned with 2012s Prometheus-a visual treat that had some lingering questions in the plot department that left many frustrated due to logical inconsistencies. Although many of these complaints are valid, I never had any qualms with it due to the craft of Scott's work. Luckily we seem to be in a new Renaissance with the filmmaker as he is relishing in his return to arguably the genre that made his name with 2015s The Martian. Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name (and adapted by Drew Goddard), the film depicts a sole Astronaut (performed expertly by Matt Damon) stranded on the fourth planet from the sun and his challenge to survive. The structure of the film could be described as part Cast Away and part Gravity and it makes for an intense, scary and very worthwhile experience. The most surprising aspect of the film though is tone. In a scenario that evokes dread, Scott keeps the optimism at a high with his direction towards the performance and delivery from Damon. His upbeat outlook on things keeps the outlandish planetary tale grounded to earth. Being a Scott film, the entire experience looks great due to Dariusz Wolski's photography-with gliding shots of vistas, craters and that glow we associate with the Red Planet-depicting the scale and daunting task this survival story really is. With science fiction films there can be a fine balance between what can be achieved (the science) and what can't (the fiction), especially when a story wants to be taken in a serious manner. With Prometheus, the science was shoddy and this left some head scratching-but with The Martian, Scott took this unwarranted criticism to heart it seems because science isn't just a necessity to the plot but arguably the hero-proving he has the Midas touch blending the smarts with the imagination-a combination that has created the directors best film in a decade.",Brian S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Sep 25, 2015",Brian S,/user/id/797749670,RT,797749670,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/512168486/picture,The Martian

4.5,"Going into The Martian, I had pretty low expectations. Ridley Scott's previous two films, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, were huge flops. Maybe my low expectations are what made The Martian so damn good. There was not a moment in this movie where I was bored. There was a perfect balance of intensity, humor, and hope in Matt Damon's Oscar-worthy performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor  also gives a hilarious performance that is in need of some Oscar attention. Kristen Wiig, I admit, was a strange casting choice. She really wasn't given anything special to do with this role. She was kind of just...there. Overall The Martian is a fantastic film that, hopefully, should put Ridley Scott back up on a pedestal. My one flaw with this film is that the last 20 minutes of the movie felt very far fetched. But, that didn't really keep me from enjoying the film.

The writing by Drew Goddard is excellent, and Matt Damon gives one of his career-best performances as Mark Watney, a witty botanist who gets stranded on Mars. This epic tale of survival and human spirit is not only enthralling and unpredictable, but teaches the importance of science and math in a way no other mainstream Hollywood movie has done in a long time (Nolan's Interstellar doesn't really count since it's more about scientific theory and, yes, love. Love transcends time and space, apparently). I was astonished by everything this film had. The Martian is a terrific entertainment, a visual marvel, and one of the best films of 2015.

4.5,"Private Ryan needs saving again. This time his name is Watney and he is a space botanist. This uplifting, exciting adaptation of the hit novel is basically Robinson Crusoe on Mars for the modern age, but much better than that 60s flick with the monkey and the loincloth wearing ""native"" martian. I recommend not spending the extra money on 3D. I found it distracting. I'm not sure, but I think this is a case of 3D effects being applied afterward rather than being filmed with the cameras designed for that effect. The story of human ingenuity is strong enough! The all-star cast excels in each of their roles. While it is odd that this movie was in the running and won at the Golden Globes in the category Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, Damon's portrayal of Watney as a charming smart aleck is completely winning.",Byron B,False,True,False,False,4.5,"Sep 21, 2015",Byron B,/user/id/536914371,RT,536914371,,The Martian

3.5,"I really like how this film relied more on story than on action and special effects. Goddard manages to keep the screenplay interesting, and sometimes funny, throughout the entire 2 hours and 14 minutes. One of my pet peeves in movies, however, is an isolated man talking to himself and explaining all of his actions as if he knows he is being watched by an audience and is obligated to amuse them. I know that sounds a bit like saying ""Hey Matt Damon, be less entertaining,"" but what I am really saying is that I wish the film's entertainment came from a more natural place.

5.0,"""The Martian"" is arguably a perfect sci-fi movie. Ridley Scott has brought a powerful story about the struggle of survival against all odds to the big screen and he's made it even bigger by perfectly capturing the raw humanity of a search-and-rescue mission. Matt Damon was perfectly cast as stranded astronaut Mark Watney: his brevity, his humor, and his intellect spill over as he dictates his actions into a video diary. His crew, including Jessice Chastain, Michael Pena, and Kate Mara, were superb; and Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor were excellent as well. ""The Martian"" worked so well because it took the time to show how the science works: so many sci-fi films fail because they feel impossible (in some ways, this was ""Interstellar's"" failure), but ""The Martian"" expertly brings in real science to make it feel believable. A secondary reason were the stakes: it may just be one human life, but your heart is in your throat in the final rescue scene. Will he make? Won't he? It's scary- and Damon's emotional performance shows it. I think this will easily be considered for at least a few awards come January, so we'll just have to wait and see.",Prentice S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Sep 21, 2015",Prentice S,/user/id/971171868,RT,971171868,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153422489032488/picture,The Martian

4.5,"We've seen the space movies, but not like this.  Stranded on a planet years away, not enough food, only a years worth of supplies.  Recipe for disaster, but for a great movie in the right hands.  Ridley Scott did a fantastic job turning what could have easily been a long, drawn out and slow movie about being stuck on another planet to being humoures, realistic, full of problems and solving them, and all the right things needed to make this work. Some stuff was crazy, but in a situation like this one what else would you have done?  The acting is of course good, Matt Damon takes centre stage, performs great, helped with a good script with some laughs to keep us going. The effects are amazing, so great to look at and compete with those of Gravity but taking a different perspective on space. I'm sure much of this movie isn't possible, but they make it convincing, it all looks good, flows good, sounds good, and grabs your attention.  It would the worst thing ever to be stranded on a planet thinking you have a year to scrape a living together before you die along, and they show that, and also the skill and mindset to push the limit and dare to survive where it's impossible.  From beginning to end it's great, the science is good, it's all surprisingly interesting for how specific it can be, and is as realistic as can be. The ending is pushing the limits do dought, of what is possible and what a crew would actually do, but it's do intense to watch, wen if we are basically 100% he will live because, well, movies rarely surprise us with a different ending unfortunately.

4.5,"Rollicking space adventure directed by Sir Ridley Scott with an oscar worthy turn from star Matt Damon.
Based on the best selling novel by Andy Weir, Damon stars as astronaut Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars when his crew mistakenly think he has died during an evacuation.
Watney has to 'science the shit' out of his situation in order to survive until the next Mars mission 4 years away.
Watney uses humour to get through, recording a video log as he goes. While back on Earth NASA have found out Watney is alive and plan a rescue mission.
Damon is perfect in the role and brings humanity & humour to the film. All the supporting cast are also on top form especially Jessica Chastain as Watneys Commander & Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA.

4.5,"Ridley Scott, the man that bought us Alien, Gladiator and on the other end of the spectrum, Prometheus and the Counselor. When I first seen the trailers for The Martian, i thought that looks great! But the thought of Prometheus hit me, the trailers looked amazing for that too and look what happened with that movie, i thought. Well tonight I finally got to see The Martian. first of all, one of the biggest aspects of Ridley Scotts best movie - Alien which is often overlooked is its humanity. The fact its characters are going about there job, when this terrible creation is forced upon them. The same thing applies to The Martian, Watney and his crew mates are just doing there job on Mars when a turn of event leads to the obvious solitude of Watney. All thru the movie, a theme is obvious throughout, human spirit. The constant thought of ok I'm fucked but how do I unfuck myself? Basically for those who don't to read the f word, he constantly never gives up, despite being marooned on Mars and having nothing but disco music to listen too.  Watney is also a very human character, at one point he uses fuck quite a few times to tell NASA of his displeasure about decisions that have been made. The cast is great, obviously Matt Damon is great, but I can't really think of a bad Matt Damon movie off the top of my head, Sean Bean doesn't die (oddly enough) and the rest of the crew keeps the quality of acting and story telling high. This movie is gripping, towards the end when the final act was happening my stomach was in knots. Its so well told, is this really the same Ridley Scott that imposed Promtheus and The Counseolor upon us? It feel
s real, it took the beauty of Prometheus (no matter how shit that movie was it was beautiful to look at), the humanity of Alien and with a kind of Apollo 13 feel brings a great movie to watch.

4.0,"Some science fiction is meant to be escapist. It takes you to fantastical realms, shows you bizarre alien species, and uses super-cool and futuristic technology. The Martian is not one of those films. Set in the near future, it shows a realistic depiction of what manned missions to Mars could look like for humanity.

Astronaut Mark Watney finds himself stranded on Mars, following the events of a Martian storm. He must use his great intellect, engineering skills, and wry sense of humour to survive, both physically and psychologically. Though he never stops giving his all, he finds himself beset by setback after setback, always finding a way through it.

Matt Damon was a fantastic choice for Watney. He is able to show the character's smarts, determination, and wit with equal skill. The rest of the Mars crew all did well, although I sometimes feel that Jessica Chastain overacts. I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor on the Earth side of things.

I really enjoyed the book, and strongly recommend it, as it has even more Mars problem-solving action.

And now he has nothing but his wit and his scientific background to survive the hostile environment of Mars and I must say, almost everything about this movie was executed flawlessly. The cast was tremendous. Matt Damon did a solid performance of being optimistic despite the fact that he's only human being on Mars.

4.0,"It's weird. With everything The Martian has going on and going for it you'd think it might be more of a straightforward action film, but rather this is a movie about problem solving. Problem solving in the cheesy sense of never giving up, but legitimate in that our protagonists circumstances have him stranded on Mars. These days, one almost goes into a Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) picture with the expectation of receiving something handsome without necessarily having any sustenance and that reaction has been warranted over the last few years (Prometheus has it's lovers and it's haters, but I'm in the former camp). What makes The Martian different than say Robin Hood, The Counselor or even Exodus though is that it once again sets the director up in what seems to be his most comfortable and inspiring setting: space. In going back to the cosmos, the director does his own problem solving and dives head first into his grand new science fiction film by embracing every aspect that makes up this story. Whether that be in the Mars-based segments with Matt Damon's astronaut Mark Watney or on Earth at the various NASA headquarters with engaging intellects like Chewitel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. Beyond having rounded up a stellar cast Scott has more or less crafted his most entertaining film in years by really seeming passionate about the material. Of course, rather than space, this could be the reason all of his films taking place out of our planet's orbit tend to generally turn out for the best. Scott is an explorer, a man who likes his scope large and his stories fairly bombastic. What bigger canvas is there to paint on than space?

There is just the right amount of science in the martian, enough to make you feel like you get it but not so much it becomes convoluted.

4.0,"EDIT: Uh, my review for this disappeared somehow? WTF? Anyways, original review from October 2, 2015: Following what seems to be sci-fi's more ""highbrow"" resurgence, now seems like a logical time for The Martian to come out. I haven't read the 2011 novel on which it's based, but I felt as if I more or less knew what to expect. The Martian seems to be the most recent yearly blockbuster sci-fi movie, following 2013's Gravity and 2014's Interstellar, and it also seems to be a movie that connects the other two in terms of star power and ambitions. This seems to be closer to the movie that Interstellar tried to be, and although The Martian isn't necessarily anything mind-blowing, what it does is well executed, well acted, and surprisingly funny, making for an entertaining-if not unforgettable-ride. Given its basic premise of an astronaut being stranded on Mars, The Martian does present itself with a high-concept idea that has tons of opportunities for both epic set pieces and a lot of interesting themes. What's refreshing is that the movie doesn't position itself in a place where it either relies on or takes advantage of its more thrilling sequences. It's less of a sci-fi epic than it is an interesting, more dialogue-driven movie that just happens to have a protagonist stranded on Mars and is bookended by two great action sequences. There's a good amount of funny dialogue here, and paired with the performances, the humor doesn't feel out of place or awkward. All of the actors do very good jobs at the least, including but not limited to Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain, and Kristen Wiig. This is a lighter movie than I expected, but that isn't to say that it's flippant; it still has a strong emotional core. Matt Damon does a very good job at carrying the movie, and it's refreshing to see him get a chance to be funny. Before I get to front-and-center criticisms, let me say that The Martian avoids being amazing mostly because its ambitions either could have been higher or have been exceeded in the past. What the movie does go for, though, is well directed and executed as a whole, but the movie is more of a fun ride than an experience. Again, it's a very good movie, but it's not something that I'll necessarily want to see again or analyze. The movie's emotional core is strong, but it seems to only go on humankind's determination to survive when it could have gone farther. Although The Martian isn't a science fiction experience that would be able to go toe-to-toe with movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey-or Gravity, for more similar comparisons-it's strong from its technical aspects to its performances. It's well paced and somewhat surprising in its humor and more science-driven dialogue. It may not be one of the best movies of the year, but it is one of the better ones. 8/10, really good, one thumb up, above average, etc.",Matt C,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Sep 13, 2015",Matt C,/user/id/905085554,RT,905085554,,The Martian

4.5,"The Martian Review By Cole LaBruzzo and Taylor Davis 

""It's gonna be four years for another mission to Mars and I'm in a lab designed to last 31 days. So I have to make water and grow food on a planet where nothing grows.â? - Mark Watney (The Martian) 

The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) and stars Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, The Bourne Trilogy, The Departed) as astronaut Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars that is supposed to last two months but instead only lasts two days due to a severe storm. When trying to evacuate, Mark is hit with debris and stranded on Mars while his crew leaves because they think the debris killed him. However, Mark is alive and now has to figure out how to survive 4 years with limited supplies and no connection to Earth or NASA. 

The acting is definitely one of the high points of this movie, particularly Damon's performance as astronaut Mark Watney. Damon was very believable in the role and managed to pull off comical moments and moments of intense peril. He had to carry a lot of the movie on his own which is a tough feat to accomplish but he did it well. The supporting cast includes Jessica Chastain (Interstellar), Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), who also do an amazing job. They sell the intensity and drasticness of the situation very well. 

Throughout the film, we see Watney applying accurate scientific methods to ration his food and supplies. You really get the feeling of how hard he worked to survive on the planet. Furthermore, the visuals were spectacular, with the feeling you are actually on Mars: Mars actually looks like Mars and not just a boring desert. The story was well shot and well told and the viewer is always interested in what's happening.

In the end we really enjoyed The Martian and thought it was well-acted and spectacularly directed. It is definitely an experience that should be seen in the movie theater and we highly recommend seeing it in theaters. 9/10",Taylor D,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 13, 2015",Taylor D,/user/id/966570583,RT,966570583,,The Martian

4.0,"Ridley Scott is back !! And he couldn't have chosen a bigger movie to triumphantly return to form. 

The movie is out of this world(Ooooohhh!) and surprisingly funny. Matt Damon is effortlessly funny and intense and carries the movie brilliantly. Everyone could sense that he was comfortable in his role and that he made it his own. The supporting A-list cast was really great. Standouts to me were Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Michael PeÃÂ±a (Who is funnier in the Martian than in Antman, go figure) and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Kristen Wiig, noticeably, has a small role in the movie and felt like a wasted opportunity, while Donald Glover's performance and character just took me out of the movie and made me feel like I'm looking at a babysitter trying to make a 2 year old laugh and is trying everything to get a response.

The story moves at a great pace. It is a long movie, but I never felt like looking at the time to gauge how much of the movie was left. I can't think of any scene that I could edit out of the movie and I have never been more satisfied by holding in my pee. The movie gets over the top at times but it stays true to the tone of the movie (Except for the Iron man scene. That was a stretch. An epic stretch, but a stretch nonetheless). It's hilarious and action packed- akin to a Marvel Studios movie, but with more tension and 'believable/realistic' stakes.

This is the first movie directed by Ridley Scott to be taking place in space following his last hit Prometheus which while many found it long and boring, I thought it was a great spin-off of arguably his most popular movie to date, 1979's sci-fi/horror masterpiece Alien. I've been waiting for Mr. Scott to direct another space movie for the longest of time as whenever he gets behind the camera he takes you into a world that you can believe is real even though chances are you will never get to see it no matter what. What interested me the most was that this wasn't gonna be a thriller like Alien or Prometheus, so I was kind of curious how this story was gonna play out. Now I know that recently, the ""space travel/survival"" genre has been used, just a bit much, (ex. Gravity, Interstellar), but let me tell you, after seeing this, I can honestly say that Mr. Scott has created one of the best survival movies I have ever seen, not just in the sci-fi genre, but in cinema in general.

The story is about a couple of NASA astronauts on a mission on Mars that goes wrong due to complications by a storm and are forced to abort mission and evacuate Mars. Unfortunately during the evacuation, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets injured and presumed dead  and is left behind by his crew members who are forced to leave as soon as possible. Luckily for Whitley, he's still alive and during his stay on Mars, he plans ahead how to stay alive until help is able to come, which involves having to cultivate in space using human feces as fertilizer, rationing his food supplies, and even creating solar panels to recharge his terrain vehicle in order to head to the destination of the next planned mission to Mars which would be at approximately two and a half years. Elsewhere back on Earth, the Head of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and many others struggle for ways of sending supplies over to Mars to aid Watney before a rescue mission could even be attempted.

To put it bluntly, the entirety of the movie is centered around 2 things: Watney's struggle to survive and NASA's attempts to try and come up with a plan that is not only effective, but possible given the heavy circumstances and sacrifices required to do so. Funny enough, you would think that this movie would play it safe and just be overly serious, dramatic and filled to the brim with tension and suspense, but to my surprise, this movie knows how to always look at the positive side and showcase a lot of well placed humor based entirely on the characters' personality and actions, most of it by Damon himself. Matt Damon completely owns this movie and dominates the screen every time he's in frame. He's always keeping a cheerful and optimistic attitude despite the fact that he's, you know, alone on fucking Mars, and always manages to crack a joke no matter the circumstance is. Even after getting blown the fuck up by his own stupidity (yes I'm being serious), he still manages to make a funny here and there and keeps himself sane and smiling no matter what the situation is. This is bar-none Damon's best performance to date and I can see him getting nominated for an Oscar for his performance.

The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking to look at, especially if you see it in 3D. Mars has never looked so beautiful and mysterious, yet at the same time it has never felt so close to the touch. The sound editing and music direction knows how to set the mood perfectly depending on the situation and scenario, but if anyone deserves credit, it's Mr. Scott himself for how wonderful his direction during the scenes on Mars. This is one of the best space movies I've ever seen as it actually felt like you've entered another planet than the one you're accustomed to here on Earth. Speaking of Earth, the scenes around it are handled pretty well as well, however I felt that some scenes dragged on just a bit too long than they probably should, to the point where some plot points get introduced, but don't actually serve a purpose until many minutes later when the plot needs it to.

Aside from that, The Martian is one of the best movies I've seen all year and this movie is without a doubt, a huge contender for awards season as I can see Ridley Scott and Matt Damon getting nominated for their contributions to the film. The Martian is a funny, creative and wonderfully executed story of survival in space, but it also has a side of realism that follows true to fact without coming across as boring or complicated for people to see (unlike the aforementioned Interstellar). It's one of the best movies of this year and I highly recommend it for all to see. It's good to see you back Mr. Scott.

4.0,"The Martian is a great cinematic experience about an astronautâ(TM)s survival on Mars, the likes of Matt Damonâ(TM)s performance, the visuals, and a sharp direction it is one entertaining science fiction film. There are other space science fiction films that show an intense experience like Gravity and Interstellar. Gravity is more an intense ride and Interstellar had more of an emotional depth on the characters. The Martian is about problem solving when it comes to isolation and instincts of survival.  The film is like Cast Away but with a setting that takes place on Mars.

 The film does not waste any time with the plot, it kicks off right as Mark (Matt Damon) and his crew are wrapping up there mission on Mars before a big storm hits, that causes them to immediately evacuate the planet. As they all rush to the shuttle, Mark gets hit and lost through the storm. Commander Melissa (Jessica Chastain) and her crew assume Mark is dead and leave the planet to head home. Mark wakes up, injured, and realizes his crew has all left. He decides to set a course of survival plans like growing food, and rationing supplies to last him until the next rescue crew will set course. Meanwhile on Earth, NASA director Teddy (Jeff Daniels) and his team try to figure out a plan on what is best to take to bring home their astronaut.


 The plot is a simple survival story, and the pacing of it does switch seeing Mark coming in situations and thinking out loud and figure out a solution to almost every single situation he sees. Yes, it may be hard to worry for his character, since he is pure genus at what he does to survive, from growing potatoes, conserving energy and reestablishing a communication unit. Then, it switches to Earth, we see Jeff Danielâ(TM)s character more worried about bringing home the remaining of the space crew and the media look on NASA.


 The film does have a huge talented cast that all did well and Matt Damonâ(TM)s fun performance. Ridley Scott direction is a steady one this time with a smart paced script by Drew Goddard. Once, the third act arrives, the stakes for the character does rise when Jessica Chastain and her crew perform a rescue mission that puts everyone at risk. The Martian is a good science fiction film, the premise of seeing Mark Watneyâ(TM)s problem solving skills is entertaining and fun, and all while Ridley Scott does deliver a visual cinematic experience.",Orlando O,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Sep 06, 2015",Orlando O,/user/id/884474625,RT,884474625,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000107605164/picture,The Martian

4.5,"In recent years, Hollywood has seen a resurgence of space exploration films. In 2013, it was Alfonso Cuarón's, Gravity. Last year, it was Christopher Nolan's, Interstellar. This year, it's Ridley Scott's, ""The Martian''. The cast includes: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Jeff Daniels, and Sean Bean. Ironically, this film is coming out during a time when it seems people are taking an interest again in space travel. In the 60's--the golden age of space exploration--people were crazy about this stuff, and unfortunately, that excitement has died down over the last thirty years. Coincidentally, this a time when the planet Mars has been all over the news. As some of you may know, water was found on the Red Planet just this past week.

The film begins with a crew of American astronauts exploring the planet, Mars. Among them is botanist, Mark Watney (Damon), who is stranded on the Red Planet after a ferocious dust storm. His crew, suspecting that he is dead, leaves him unintentionally behind. With limited rations and supplies, Watney has to survive on the desolate landscape, alone. Using his intellect, knowledge of science, and incredible botanist skills, Mark manages to survive and grow food for himself. The only question is; how long can he stay alive?

Matt Damon is one of those actors in films that you can just always connect with. He has this great screen presence, even if he's playing a bad-cowardly astronaut; or a good-brave astronaut who has to survive. Seriously, after his last space film, one would think they'd think twice about sending him into space again. And yes, he gets blown out of the airlock--again. All Interstellar jokes aside, Damon gives one of the best performances I've seen him give in years. His character is really funny, and most importantly, relatable. For a guy trapped and isolated on another planet, he sure is optimistic. While admittedly, he is the only character you care about, the other cast members still give great performances. Seriously, the cast assembled is almost more impressive than the cast Nolan got.

As with any space opera, this film looks incredible. Not just the stunning cinematography by Darius Wolski, but the gorgeous visual effects. With director Ridley Scott, it's hit or miss. One thing is always guaranteed however, and that's the incredible visuals. The CGI in this film is utterly flawless. The planets, ships, and landscapes look surreal. Not only are the fake visuals great, the sets, costumes, and practical effects are as well. The space suits, while looking a bit too futuristic for my taste, reminded me very much of the suits in Kubrick's, 2001. Even more impressive are the sets. They looked so good, and the gorgeous cinematography showed them off in great, wide and symmetrical shots.

The plot of, The Martian is pretty familiar, yet effective. It's incredibly straight forward. A guy gets trapped and isolated far from home. He has to brave the elements and survive until he is rescued. We've seen this before, many, many times. Of course this time, the stakes are higher. Our protagonist isn't stranded on a remote island or behind enemy lines. He's stuck on a completely different planet. On the ground, we've got all these people from NASA and other agencies, trying to bring our boy home. The cuts between Earth and mars were very well handled. The time spent on both locations was just right, and well balanced.

Finally, we can't glance over Ridley Scott's solid direction. Recently, and it's no secret, Scott's been making films that haven't been too impressive. It's been years since he's made a film this good. Many of you will know him as the director of Alien, Gladiator, and Blade Runner. This is most certainly, his best film since those classics. Allot of that has to do with the amazing, funny, and witty script. Drew Goddard wrote the screenplay, an is known for his work on: Cabin in the Woods, World War Z, and several famous television series. 

""The Martian'' is a visually stunning, funny, and thrilling film. It brings out the best in director Ridley Scott and actor Matt Damon. While it's not a perfect masterpiece, and there are occasional moments where things get a bit slow, it's still one of the better films of the year. It's an almost nail biting experience, with great dialogue, amazing visuals, and incredible action sequences. The last act of the film is really exciting, and reminded me of an amped up version of a particular scene in 2001. There are even a few direct visual references to that classic masterpiece, making me respect Scott as a director even more.",Alasdair B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 03, 2015",Alasdair B,/user/id/899526316,RT,899526316,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000568330954/picture,The Martian

This movie was actually really good and a lot of fun, mainly to its impressive cast and dynamic, but also thanks to an excellent performance by Matt Damon. Not only did the setting (Mars) looked very beautiful but it also looked very real, and it had that based on a true story feel that made even better. Also, it's supporting cast was great, with Jessica Chastain and Kristen Wiig as some of its A list cast. Overall, the movie is clearly a feel good movie, that although it isn't an action movie, it is very exciting and well made.

4.0,"This movie was not as good as I wanted it to be, but that is in part due to my reading the book first.

I think I give the edge to last year's ""Interstellar"" for pure scope and emotional impact, but I must admit that the final rescue attempt, even though I knew the outcome, still had a major impact on me.

And in a few ways, at least, the film improves on the book and takes full advantage of the visual medium to represent concepts that were tricky to get across in print. And most importantly, in my mind, it respects the intelligence of the viewer (usually) to figure out certain things without it having to be explicitly spelled out, while still being careful to keep them apprised of the higher level science that goes into surviving on Mars alone.",Wesley M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Sep 02, 2015",Wesley M,/user/id/786463994,RT,786463994,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/650063272/picture,The Martian

5.0,"The Martian is a great movie that everyone has to see. It's like Castaway in that Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, is trying to survive alone in a hostile environment. But, in this movie, There is a whole planet trying to save him. It's message, which is reiterated unnecessarily at the end of the movie in a scene that does not appear in the novel, is relevant to anyone living today. There are a few minor quibbles that do not distract from the movie but which readers might find a little disappointing. For instance, a chunk of time is missing by using the obligatory '7 months later'. There were a couple of set pieces from the time span that would have been good to see in the movie. But, to keep the movie at a manageable time, I can see why Ridley Scott did this. I am hoping for a longer Director's Cut in the future. There is a character that I was disappointed with. Annie Montrose was a much stronger character in the novel. As the face of Public Relations for NASA, we should have seen more of her in the movie. They underutilized Kristen Wiig in that role. They also combined a few scenes for time's sake. But, overall it is still a great movie. It is exciting and humorous just like the novel. Go see it. Take your family and your friends. 
NOTE: I saw the movie in 3D and it looked great! None of the effects will make you a little queasy.",Art R,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Sep 01, 2015",Art R,/user/id/852711687,RT,852711687,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/615145312/picture,The Martian
5.0,"I was able to go to an early screening of the Martian. It is terrific and true to the book. I have seen reviews that call it smart and funny and that is an apt description. Another aspect that I found particular good was the use of expansive views of Mars to emphasize the utter aloneness that Watney experiences in contrast most of the off Mars scenes show characters together,rarely alone and often in seemingly crowded areas. I think this was on purpose and it works. Whether a press conference in a room packed with reporters or at JPL with 20 nerds (I mean that  in the best possible way) packed into a room working to solve some engineering problem, the contrast is poignant. 

Several performances deserve special attention. Matt Damon's excellent performance as Watney deserved all the accolades that other reviewers have places upon him. Also, Donald Glover as Rich Purnell was terrific. The part is small but he really shines. Mackenzie Davis as Mindy park also shined. And finally Chiwetel Ejiofor as Venkat Kapoor stand out as a stellar performance. 

The music provided a funny and ironic note to the film, especially the first one that plays during the credits.

4.5,"Whenever you get Ridley Scott onto a movie you never know what you're going to get recently Scott hasn't been able to do anything right (though I did like Prometheus, I know a lot of people didn't but I did) like The Counselor, Exodus (I never saw Robin Hood though I heard people say it's bad). Scott might actually be back to form after directing this movie, I believe it takes just one movie to bring use to be good directors back to form, this movie was awesome. Matt Damon absolutely killed if in this movie, I think this might be Damon's best performance since Good Will Hunting. This movie is loaded with science, I'm not very big on knowledge of science but this movie made me interested and knowing that you could use science in a way to survive on a planet that does not grow vegetation. There is such more scientific stuff in this movie but I'm only gonna tell you that one because that is what the trailer showed you. The movie is long but what was so cool is that it did not feel like it at all, the movie is so good that you can't take your eyes off of it. What's cool is that the movie doesn't just focus on Matt Damon is focuses on NASA and how they're trying to help him survive and figure out a way to help him get home. I kinda laughed at everyone who thought this movie was a true story, but then I applaud the movie for being so good that people actually thought this was a true story. Common people if this was a true story don't you think we would all know about it? This story would be told forever if it was real.

3.5,"Ridley Scott is definitely one of the most hit or miss directors out there. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" are clearly his most praised works. ""Gladiator"" is definitely a classic and it has a pretty big fanbase. Also, some people argue that ""Black Hawk Down"" is even on the same level with ""Apocalypse Now"" and other classic war films (which by the way, I agree with that statement). However, he has also produced many hated films in the 2000's which have been called major disappointments by many. However, I still had hopes for this one because sci-fi tends to be his strongest genre. My anticipation definitely paid off and ""The Martian"" is clearly the best film he's made in a while and it proves that it might be his comeback.

After an astronaut gets stranded on Mars after a storm hits his crewmates, he finds out that he must find a way to signal Earth that he is still alive and he has to figure out how to survive until then.

There have been a lot of comparisons to last years ""Interstellar"". Unlike ""Interstellar"", this film doesn't contain any expositions and it gets right to the inciting incident. Despite this, we never get confused during the film as it doesn't expect us to have read the book. It explains things nicely and the plot flows along smoothly. ""Interstellar"" is also very heavy on science. However, this film doesn't focus too much on intricate science concepts and it is a film which can be enjoyed by more people on the first viewing. Also, it is much less bland and its pacing makes it an easier film to watch. So for this reason, I enjoyed it much more than ""Interstellar"".

Also, I really enjoyed the visuals. The outside shots gave a great feel about how Mars looked and it made it look like a barren and desolate area. The shots from the ship looked very futuristic and it made the living quarters look super advanced and high tech. The atmosphere in the movie couldn't be much better and it really makes you feel that this film actually was filmed in space. It may not be anything new or groundbreaking in terms of space visuals but I usually don't ever mind that as long as the visuals are not underwhelming and this movies visuals are most certainly not underwhelming at all. They interested me greatly and they looked very realistic.

Most of the screen time is focused on Matt Damon in this movie. I felt that he gave a great performance. It may not be anything Oscar-worthy but he still gave a realistic performance. He was the only actor I really noticed for the majority of the movie but that didn't bother me at all because he carried the movie very well by himself.

Like most great movies, however, it isn't flawless. The pacing was a bit too slow for me at times and I felt that it could have been cut to 2 hours instead. I also felt that some scenes carried on longer than they had to. However, this didn't bother me all that much and I still enjoyed it a great deal.

After ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" grew very popular, it seems that the space survival genre is starting to become popular and we might see more films like this in the next several years. Hopefully, Ridley Scott learns off of what he did right in this movie so he can apply what he learned and make more great films in the future. I'm not completely sure if this is true but I think that this film might be his comeback into fame and he might make good films again as he once did.

4.0,"Great movie starring Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was a prequel to interstellar because in the Martian, Mark did talk about a Mann mission and in interstellar matt Damon's characters name is mann. I've always wanted to read the book since the first trailer. It's cool how the movie shown how mars is but I know it's not real, it is just a city on earth. You just want to root for Mark to get home, he does do a lot of stupid stuff in the Movie and in some parts of the movie it was funny but funny stupid. And the main question on everybody's mind for this movie is, can or beat gravity or interstellar. The Martian beats gravity but not interstellar. I liked that Mark isn't talking to himself when he's by himself on mars, he's doing a captain's log but he doesnt write it down on paper, he does a video version. I think it's called a vlog.

4.0,"With Ridley Scott returning to science fiction after two cinematic failures, The Martian Sounded like a promising return to form for the legendary director.

The Martian was a very surprising film. Some of the themes appeared to be very reminiscent of Interstellar, and considering that the film shows Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain returning to space there is certainly a sense of familiarity there. As well as that, the film seems to capitalize on the trend of recent survival-themed films such as All is Lost, Riddick and Gravity. Gravity especially seems like a familiar film due to the concept of surviving in space as well as the fact that some of the scenes in the film's final climax have very similar imagery. But I guess that's to be expected.
What isn't so familiar about The Martian is just how intelligent it is. Perhaps one of the most impressive things about The Martian is its direction. Ridley Scott is the director, and The Martian establishes that the man truly is at his best when working in science fiction, if that wasn't already clear for his efforts on Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus. What's interesting is that the direction of the story is clear, it is very straightforward. As the tale centres around the survival and rescue of the titular Mark Watney, all the cbaracters in the story know it and don't mess around with it. As a result, the story remains very focused on this clear objective and doesn't mess around with melodramatic subplots or tedious character conflict. The story keeps on moving forward once it builds its mood even though it moves at a pace slow enough to let everything develop properly yet fast enough so that there is essentially no periods of boredom over the course of the 141 minute running time. The focus of the story attempts to fit everything and everyone into the the film so that it captures the true scope of the events and scale of the spectacle which is very respectable. Admittedly, there is a feeling that there could have been more in-depth exploration of Mark Watney as a character, but at the same time the fact that he is so ready to fight for his right to survive is impressively heroic.
There is an effective balance between intelligent yet comprehensive language which respects the audience enough not to oversimplify it yet also expects them to divert their focus into it, and since the feature is naturally entertaining it is easy to keep engaged with it all. The language is smart, the characters and conversations are intelligent, and there is even a sporadic sense of humour in the film which adds a lighthearted touch to the experience and makes it more enjoyable without detracting from the serious nature of the rest of the story. The Martian is a film which is touching, intense, intelligent and funny. The writing is brilliant, and Ridley Scott knows how to treat the story properly so that it maintains a strong sense of character and spectacle the entire time.
Historically, Ridley Scott has proven time and time again to have a brilliant eye for intensively atmospheric imagery. In The Martian it is interesting because there is intense dedication to detail thanks to Wadi Rum's production design of Mars which he has achieved many times before, yet it isn't the main focus. This is because the setting is so convincing that it actively feels natural, making the fictional nature of the narrative forgettable and drawing viewers into the story very well. The dedication to detail is spectacular and it is all captured with cinematography that incorporates in both epic techniques to capture the scale of it all and western techniques to emphasize the dry, dead horizon. The visual effects are also excellent, particularly in portraying the space journey of the characters. And yet, there is more than enough genuine narrative heft to ensure that the film never falls back on relying on its visual elements, rather moderating them with a story in a very practical fashion. Frankly, The Martian is one of the first science fiction films in a long time which relies on genuinely intelligent writing to succeed without relying on visual effects even though it has them there and ready to present impressive imagery whenever it is necessary.
And riding the success of the brilliant screenplay, the cast in The Martian have no problem delivering their greatest talents
Matt Damon delivers his greatest performance in years. Once again needing to be rescued and in space, Matt Damon has essentially created a trend for two narratives which converge into one for his role in The Martian. He is alone on a planet talking to himself and the camera essentially the entire time, and it could not feel more real. Though there is clearly a sense of humane frailty to him, what's more impressive is how genuinely intelligent he seems in his understanding of and physical engagement with the set. He is impeccably convincing, but more importantly he is able to hold the screen on the basis of his natural spirit. Matt Damon has an intelligent but lighthearted mood to him in The Martian, successfully bringing a sense of humour to the film which keeps it consistently more optimistic and more enjoyable which means that it serves as a strong testament to his ability to hold the screen even when he has nobody else to engage with directly. Matt Damon's natural charms and intelligent character tenacity are remarkable assets to The Martian, making the human edge of the film unexpectedly funny in the most delightful manner.
Jeff Daniels is also great. Playing the director of NASA, Jeff Daniels has the responsibility of being very blunt with his character. It's impressive because I expected him to be an emotionless archetype, and yet he was exceptionally professional and human at the same time. He had to look out for the interests of his professional career first, but you can tell he wants Mark Watney to survive as much as anyone else which makes him a likable figure even if viewers don't always see eye to eye with his decisions. Jeff Daniels has a very sophisticated line delivery in The Martian, limiting his emotional input to an appropriately restrained extent so capture an ideal nature for the character. Jeff Daniels' supporting effort is an effective reminder of his extensive dramatic talents and establishes his career resurgence in dramatic cinema.
And in a refreshing turn of events, Donald Glover makes a cinematic transition very nicely. At first I got mixed feelings out of him because his spaced out nature as an astrodynamicist is first played off for comedic effect in a manner very much like his iconic role as Troy Barnes in Community which isn't precisely the most sophisticated or original element, but at the same time I do admit that I have long missed him since his departure from Community. His role later proves to be very brief, but the way he talks about the scientific material in the screenplay is brilliant. He comes off as being very smart, and is so natural about it that he doesn't have to force any persona to go with it. Donald Glover delivers what fans have grown to love about him while also depicting an innovative step forward for a cinematic career.
And though their supporting roles are essentially all of equal importance and impact, the efforts of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena and Sean Bean are all effective. Even the lesser known Benedict Wong delivers an intelligent effort.

So The Martian may have similar elements to some recent science fiction films, but it brings the best of them to an original and intelligent film with a brilliantly sophisticated and funny screenplay, brilliantly atmospheric and stylish direction from Ridley Scott in his best genre and Matt Damon bringing his most charming effort in a long time.",Harry W,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Aug 21, 2015",Harry W,/user/id/891495465,RT,891495465,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1008742212/picture,The Martian

5.0,"I absolutely loved this movie! It's now an all time favorite. I've been thinking about it since I saw it yesterday. Spoiler Alert:
The scene when Watney travels from the Hab to the Ares IV had several shots that were really beautiful, I just loved them. The music during that scene was great too. I can't wait to watch it again. Also, when Beck exited the Hermes I got vertigo. I had that happen in the movie Sunshine when they were repairing panels on their ship. Loved that feeling both times! I also liked how they made you feel like Beck may just float away at some point, but it wasn't annoying the way Sandra Bullock got the crap beat out of her every single time she opened a door in Gravity, that really bothered me. I loved Watney's conversations with the camera, it reminded me of Moon, which is another one of my favorite movies.
Here is my list of nit pickey things that stood out and briefly took me out of the movie magic.
- dog barking in overhead night shot of Pasadena (made me realize all shots were indoors or on Mars and took me out of the movie because it reminded me of E.T.)
- bird flying near the window when the first probe launched (felt overly intended and was annoying)
-Â  a piramid shaped pile of sand under the rover when it left the Hab for the last time (perhaps it was intended to make us concerned it would get stuck on it, but it distracting and made me miss the rest of the shot, so I was bummed)
- two tornados looked like they were in stereo and I forgot my 3D glasses (didn't see the 3D version) when Watney stood from the high vantage point talking about being the only person who had been to that place (dust devils in other shots looked absolutely amazing, making these two bad ones stand out)
- two shots were poorly comped while Watney put the parachute on the Ares IV (they would have been fine in another movie, but stood out in this overall fantastic movie)
- Johanssan had a messy gob of blush in the scene when the crew found out Watney was alive (which made me notice the commander also had makeup on, in space. Silly.)
- Vogel's accent seemed thicker in some parts, which made me think there was another crewmember when he was talking to Johanssan at the treadmill and in the kitchen making the bomb, when the accent seemed less. Or maybe he was just joking with a thicker accent earlier. I dunno, will have to watch it again I guess ;)
- the commander and Watney at the end reminded me of Eve and Wall-e, (but it was beautifully done and a total relief after the heart pounding anxiety up until that moment.)
- during the ending credits the commander seemed pissed off about the next launch. (Not sure how she was supposed to be feeling, but it came off negative)",Landis Anna F,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Aug 17, 2015",Landis Anna F,/user/id/903630462,RT,903630462,,The Martian

The cinematography made it feel like they were actually filming on Mars or in space. This was truly an all star cast and everyone played their role fantastically.

5.0,"The movie definitely met my expectations. 

The casting was perfect, and the actors all created amazing and memorable performances. Donald Glover stole the Earth scenes with his portrayal of the brilliant astrophysicist Rich Purnell; Jeff Daniels was an ideal straight-edged NASA director Teddy Sanders, playing the role much as he played the role of Will McAvoy on Showtime's ""The Newsroom"". The star role of Mark Watney was, unsurprisingly, fulfilled by Matt Damon as if the role were written for him. I only wished that Damon had had more of an opportunity to showcase the character's intelligence and self-reliance as a mechanical engineer as much as a botanist, because this was part of what made the book's character so fascinating to read. Instead, they played up on his sense of humor in the face of adversity, and played up his sense of vulnerability. Damon adapted his performance to these changes well, and I still found it very enjoyable.

The screenplay did fantastic job of faithfully recreating the heart of this story. No movie can ever encompass the true brilliance, depth, and nuance of a book, but this one worked hard to do so and kept the most integral themes alive. 

My only complaints were with the cinematic details: those tiny minutiae that make me walk out of the theatre asking, ""Really?"" Little things like the fact that I kept looking for wires in the space scenes, because they didn't bother with any other microgravity conditions' limitations other than floating around in weird ways. Questions like, ""Why are all the women's hair perfect?"" Silly little things that I noticed, but many viewers won't care about, like astronauts having perfectly placed hair with make-up on, even though they're on their 400+ day in space...

5.0,"Space movies have become a popular thing. In the past, we had Apollo 13 (which came out around my birthday) and Armeggedan. In 2013, Gravity came out which was visually spectacular and the year after that, Interstellar came out and was all done with practical effects. What do different about this one? It's set in Mars, based on a book and stars Matt Damon.

 
I got in the theatre a couple of minutes late to this preview screening and when I got there, the 3D wasn't working. Once everything got resolved, it took me a while to really dive in the movie but once I did, I loved it. Sure, it's not the best movie out there but it is visually spectacular and has a stellar cast, just like all the previous space movies. The only difference is that we get to see how a man survives on Mars and it is incredible what he does in order to survive. The great part is that they explain everything to you in a way that you understand. 

I was surprised that I laughed so much while watching this film. I thought that it was going to be very dramatic. Sometimes, I forgot that I was watching a movie. I felt as if I was actually on this journey. Jeff Daniels is an incredible actor. There were some weak parts here and there in the final act. It was still suspenseful but it seemed like everything happened so quick and I think it could be the due to the fact that I watched this late at night and I felt a bit tired at the end. I may need to see this movie again and see if my opinion has changed.

In the end of the day, I would recommend this to anyone who thinks that Ridley Scott has lost his touch because even though this may not be his best, it certainly did bring him back up.

4.0,"If you read the book then you may be left wanting, but if you didn't then you should really enjoy it. I, having read the book, really wished that this movie would have been a bit longer and could have used the time to explain who people were and how Mark managed to stay alive. The only real survival elements that were mentioned in the movie were food and communication. There were many more in the book that were left out like how Mark was able to get all the survival equipment to function and fit in the small space of the rover or how he managed to make the trip across mars. My only other point of contention was the lack of character introduction. People were talking, making decisions, deciding his fate and the audience did not even know who they were or what they knew. Although the movie felt like it did a decent enough job representing the source material and stripping the movie down so that it towed the line between entertaining and true to the source material.

5.0,"Rating: Flawless 

This is exactly the reason why I go to the movies. All of the essential aspects such as direction, writing, acting, and visuals are stunning and seamless. Let's break some of it down.

Ridley Scott is back with a wonderfully directed film that is compelling from the beginning. The plot starts quickly and keeps up the tension throughout. One great aspect that helps to deal with such a desperate situation of a lone man stranded on Mars is the humor of the film. This is largely presented by Matt Damon's perfect comedic timing and tone. Speaking of Damon he leads the movie in a way that proves he is a class A superstar. You always believe that his emotions are genuine and match those of someone striving to survive. He moves with ease between dry humor and sheer despair, all while keeping the cool head of a brilliant astronaut. 

And Matt Damon is not the solo performance that deserves heaps of praise, since this movie is stacked with premium talent. I won't list everyone here because there are too many great people, but let's just say there are plenty of actors you will recognize playing supportive roles in all the right ways. This might lead to the only minor problem with the movie, in that you have so many stellar actors that their roles are minimal. Some more development in certain characters could have been nice to see, but again that is nitpicking. 

What makes a film truly special is when the message resonates with you as a person, and the Martian does that and even makes you believe in the collective power of humanity.

Damon is excellent as the focus of the story, bringing extra depth to the character of Watney, who could have come off as an unsympathetic knowitall jerk in the wrong hands, and the starry supporting cast, from Community's Donald Glover as a wired, awkward back room boy with an audacious rescue plan, all the way up to Jeff Daniels NASA chief facing with tough choices are all note perfect (except for Sean Bean, horribly miscast as the flight director, who I would have been happy for the film makers to deviate from the book in order to find a way to keep his ""screen deaths"" ratio up..).

5.0,"When Ridley Scott was set to direct The Martian, I was pretty excited to see it as Ridley Scott can do no wrong to science fiction movies, although Prometheus is a bit split by viewers. So when Drew Goddard is the writer of the film, there is no skepticism for me at all and actually did thought that this going to be a fantastic movie, especially when my best friend thought so too, which after watching the movie, The Martian didn't disappoint me. It goes to the main character being stranded already in the first 5 minutes, and that's pretty much where the movie is now going to start. Matt Damon did a fantastic job at it and would probably get nominated for an Oscar. Knowing Ridley Scott as an visionary director, the special effects better be very gorgeous, and they are, and didn't look at all CG. The plot is very simple, in fact, similar to Gravity, one of my favorite space movies, but it does it very well that make it stand out from Gravity. For a survivor movie, all it needs to do to succeed, are great and memorable characters, some good thrills, and don't ever drag out, which The Martian has done all of that. The accuracy in this is really good for space, and it's very funny and smart. While The Martian, in my opinion, is not quite as memorable as Gravity, but I do know that Ridley Scott, Drew Goddard, and Matt Damon do what they do best to make it work out and be very faithful to the book which they succeed and might make me read the book that inspired the movie to be made.",Brandon W,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jul 17, 2015",Brandon W,/user/id/912949741,RT,912949741,,The Martian

5.0,This was really a great movie.  Matt Damon played his role very well.  It had elements that reminded me of Tom Hanks in Castaway but with a rescue mission in the mix.

4.5,"The Martian is an original movie made up of other movie plots like Cast Away and Apollo 13. The focus behind this a sci-fi flick follows the mission to Mars and when a dastardly storm hits and knocks out astronaut Mark Watney, and as a result is stranded on the distant planet until someone gets contact with him. What makes this movie so much like other movies is not only slightly pertaining to their premises but also its small but noticeable cliches. The Martian uses the ""using gravitational pull to fling us to earth"" strategy like in Apollo 13 and uses Cast Away's ""to whom it may concern take care of this, it saved my life"" note. It also has the cliche control room celebration scene that is effective but overused. What's not cliche is Matt Damon's performance as wisecrack, Mark Watney. Mark Watney is a normal, but intelligent human being that through all his work and shenanigans, always entertains and gives a very charismatic performance. His character acts goofy sometimes because in a situation like that, people handle stress by cracking jokes and to make lightness of a dark moment and whenever he said a joke it was nearly always funny. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a really great performance too that is a complete standout along with Damon. He too was charismatic and got down to business when he needed to and continually made differences throughout the film. The casting overall was fantastic, the whole cast had great chemistry with each other. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Watney and Martinez, I thought they were really funny together. The first half of this film is some of the best film of seen put to screen this year. There's a ton of astounding things to list such as the opening scene where Watney is left behind and the way it was shot. The cinematography was miraculous to look at the whole film really. There's a scene where Ejiofor's character takes a drink from a glass of water and the water looked really pure and appealing and the camera work really went well along with that. Mars was absolutely breathtaking and is the clear standout of every set in The Martian. From the craters to the sky during the day, it was stunning in every way. Getting to see Mark plot out his everyday survival methods were the highlights of the entire film. I was convinced that he was a really smart guy and everything he did was really entertaining and fun to experience. The second half of the movie was fun too but there were times where I started losing interest because there was no Watney on screen for maybe 25 minutes and that sucked me right out of the movie. Not that it wasn't interesting what the characters on earth were doing, Mark just was so good of a character that he completely outshone most of the cast and that became distracting. The other characters were memorable for sure, like Donald Glover and Sean Bean. It's just that it felt like most of the dialogue being spoken had been said already. There was repeated references to getting him home and how the media would handle the news. It just felt too long of a stretch without Damon's charisma. There is always the lurking mystery if he will make it home because everyone lost hope at one point during the movie given the possibilities of getting there in time. The way that his survival methods and thoughts were played out nearly perfect. In the end The Martian is a memorable space adventure that is directed very well by Sir Ridley Scott. The themes of hope, survival, and intelligence being put to the ultimate test made this one of 2015's best.

4.0,"The Martian review 
The brilliance of this movie is not that Mark Watney survived, but because he never gave up. Don't get me wrong it is amazing that he survived and it is very well demonstrated and acted by Matt Damon, but the amount of effort he had to put Into farming potatoes and having his hope crushed over and over again, that is the real perception this movie/book is trying to give off and it so did give off a remarkable story. Now there are some landmarks, for instance in a situation l how could your survive off of potatoes so long, how could your boost yourself too a specific location and not actually drift somewhere off bounds, but all of that Doesn't matter. The viewers were so happy to see him succeed that every time they mark had failed, it was as if every person thought that was the end of the Mission, as if every time he failed we knew the ending. So seeing him succeed was a treat that every single person was extremely relived to witness. That is the significance of this movie, the realism, the struggle, and most of all...the effort that mark watney had to apply to leave planet Mars.

His performance was outstanding and the behind the scenes look into NASA and JPL was interesting.

4.5,"Another movie week has passed and after watching The Martian - for the first time in a long period, I left the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling. I remembered a quote from my movie podcaster who mentioned that this film in fact was everything what Interstellar wasn't for him - for some reason that quote stuck with me and I can only confirm that. Let's go step by step - the plot of The Martian is plain and simple:

During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/)

While I had heard really good things about this film in general, I tried to watch it relatively ""untouched"" - I did not really know who the cast will be (except Matt Damon) and what to expect - Drama, Science Fiction, Comedy? As it turns out, it is little bit of everything. Whereas often times, this is exactly when a movie fails as it is trying to do too many things at the same time - this is part of what makes The Martian such a great piece of entertaining. It is a well-balanced Science Fiction piece - positive in nature with tons of ""self-witt"" (if this is not an actual word, you will probably understand it once you watch the film). After seeing Matt Damon - who did hit jackpot with his most recent feature films in the past years (The Monuments Men, Elysium, Promised Land) - as Mark Watney, I almost could not imagine any other actor being able to give the character the same level of intelligence, humor and cockyness. But not only Matt Damon is the perfect fit for his role - rarely have I seen a movie in which the cast is so perfect put together AND is in such great harmony. To name a few - Jeff Daniels carries the role of the director of NASA with the same arrogance and strong will as he did his Will McAvoy character in (the good times) of The Newsroom, Kirsten Wiig proves the entire world that she can do other things than being ridiculously funny but my favorite side character in this film was Benedict Wong's character - as clichee as it was to make the Asian-American nerdy dude be in charge of putting together the rescue mission and have him be the messenger of bad news - he just cracked me up every time he appeared on screen.

I mentioned above that the film ""felt good"" - now what I mean with that; both on television and film, there is a trend of the darker, the grittier, the moodier the better (I have no facts to back this up) - maybe it also my choice of film and television. The Martian however finally creates a dramatic tale in which the focus is plain, simple and yet positive: SAVE MARK WATNEY, NO MATTER WHAT. Even whilst including elements of politics such as the collaboration of two alienating superpowers, the film does not divert into House-of-Card'ish display of dirty politics, instead it makes a plea for collaboration and helping each other to reach a common goal which has nothing to do with money and/or power. And that just felt good. And the element of humor used by all the actors making the best out of a complicated situation resonated extremely well with me at all phases of this film. And one more really refreshing element in this film - as mentioned in the /Filmcast - is that there literally are no villains in this movie. And the movie still works.

All in all, this was a perfectly balanced Science Fiction film with all the right elements - aside from Matt Damon's heartwarming performance, I believe that a lot of credit should go to Andy Weir for what must have been a fantastic book and Drew Goddard for a great screenplay - this film works on all levels and I can highly recommend it.

4.0,"""The Martian,"" the story of a man who is left in Mars by his crew only because they think he is dead, and his will to survive until help arrives. With a strong performance by Matt Damon as the lead, as well as a great supporting cast, Ridley Scott delivers one of his best in years.

Damon stars as Mark Watney, astronaut and botanist that is all alone on the desolate planet of Mars, with enough food to last him a bit, but not enough until help arrives, which would seemingly take approximately 4 years. Using his skills as a botanist, he is able to grow a supply of potatoes on a planet that doesn't grow anything at all, as well as produce water. Damon does a swell job in the role, he's smart, charismatic, likable, and you definitely root for him. He doesn't have to show too much emotion in the film, up until pivotal points like the end when all seems lost and unfortunate. Not to take anything away from him, he did a great job, especially including humor considering the circumstances. The supporting cast is great as well. Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, even Donald Glover with his small role. I think my favorite performance here comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor though, who plays Vincent Kapoor, the man who finds out Damon's character is still alive and is willing to do his utmost to bring him home to Earth. I guess he just impresses me in general, but his acting is nothing short of compelling. You get the feeling that he actually cares, and plays the role perfectly.

The plot and cinematography is great, using the landscapes of Jordan and Texas for Mars, and doing a great job making you believe that Damon is stuck on that god awful planet. The plot is simple, with minor plot twists and unfortunate events that set him back and forward at the same time. It's nothing jaw dropping, but Ridley Scott uses smart directing to make this a sort of Science Fiction film we aren't used to. There's no aliens or anything like that, it's man vs. time, and it's great.

Overall I see why this film is nominated for 7 Oscars, it has all the intangibles for such credit. The acting, the cinematography, the directing, even the soundtrack selection, which may come as a surprise fits well. It's a film you should see, and it doesn't feel like 2 and a half hours because you get sucked into the plot hoping he returns home. Well done Ridley, this may be your best in a very long time, if not ever. 4/5 JD",James D,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Jun 30, 2015",James D,/user/id/781706651,RT,781706651,,The Martian

In all seriousness, this is the most entertaining film of the year so far.

Maybe the film didn't seek to reach that same goal as those films did and it might be an unfair knock against the film, but the film could've used a little of that.

5.0,Ridley Scott director of Aliens and Blade Runner crafts this epic sci-fi action film. The Martian is one of the best films of the year. Matt Damon plays Mark Watney and he's perfect for the role. Though Matt Damons performance was great the film has an amazing cast that also do a great job with the roles they play. Everything about the film is great from the visual effects to the way film looks in terms of scenery. I've always loved Ridley Scotts movies however with The Martian I feel he has crafted his best film yet. If you love smartly crafted sci fi I recommend this film for you. The film is not your typical cliche predictable survivor story its much more refreashing. The Martian is just flat out a remarkable film the film does a great job on showing how desperate times call for desperate measures and will keep you on the edge of your seat and will keep you guessing till the very end.

4.5,"Out of this World

The Martian is an amazing and great film with very little flaws. The screenplay, the direction, the visual effects and especially the acting all stand out to make this the best film of the year so far.

There are many positives to this film. Matt Damon is fantastic in his role as astronaut Mark Watney. He plays the role with tragedy, humor and optimism. The ready of the A-list cast is great as well. The film immerses the viewer into the Martian atmosphere and makes the viewer feel like these events actually took place. This is due to the production value, the screenplay, and the direction which showcases Scott back in form. The problem solving and the messages about humanity makes this a great crowd pleaser, cheering for Watney to get home. 

There are almost no flaws to this film. All the characters have personalities and every actor gets a chance to shine in a film with so many supporting characters. But there are a few pacing problems here and there but they don't really matter. 

This is why we go to the movies. In fact, this film is impossible to dislike. The story and the film as a whole is an engaging sci fi film filled with the perfect blend of humor and drama. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar this film isn't trying to be one giant spectacle experience or be anything confusing and psychological, this is a very human and awesome film and I can't wait to watch it again.

4.5,"The Martian is a fascinating, humorous survival story. Matt Damon stars in the Ridley Scott-directed film, playing Mark Watney, a botanist who gets stuck on Mars. The film pops with excellent cinematography and visual effects, and amazing direction. The writing is filled with realism and intelligence. The acting is outstanding from the entire ensemble cast.
Matt Damon is Oscar-worthy in the lead role, hitting the humor and drama perfectly. Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kristen Wiig among others, standout at NASA, as officials trying to make the best decisions in getting Watney back. Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara lead Mark's team, also attempting to get Watney back. Donald Glover, Michael Peña, Sean Bean, and Sebastian Stan are also incredible in their smaller roles. The humor in the movie is great. Every joke hits hard.

This film follows the book very well. This film adds a little more than the the book towards the end of the film than the book by Andy Weir provides but the film stays very much close to the book. I'm glad that the main aspects which Andy Weir desired out of his book were kept such as the Loyalty and trust the crew had to their commander. The 1970's music choices. How this went to a world event where the whole world watched this crew once they heard about Mark Whatney's survival and rescue from Mars just like the book and Apollo 13. 

The settings looked Amazing in this film just by the vast size.

This was so Amazing to watch the sand storm and the science.

4.5,"It's no secret that I haven't enjoyed Ridley Scott's last few films. So I was cautiously optimistic when I heard he was doing a film with Matt Damon written by Drew Goddard. I never read the source material, so I couldn't base any idea of what I wanted, but I knew I wanted something good, at the very least. What I got was something great. The Martian strands us with an astronaut who was accidentally left behind by his crew on Mars, and he has to survive until he can find a way off the planet. For starters, bravo to Matt Damon. He truly is the heart and soul of the film, and unlike Gravity, Damon doesn't overact and gives the right amount of heft to the dramatic scenes and the right amount of levity to the lighter scenes. As for the rest of the cast, we get a fantastic one to pick apart, with Jeff Daniels being a notable standout. But like I said, this is Damon's show all the way, and it's one hell of a show. I can't say that I have ever seen farming look so damn interesting before. But that is the beauty of The Martian. Unlike Interstellar, where it tackles the technical and scientific terms head on, The Martian plays into the science and breaks it down in a simpler way because Damon is, more or less, the ""everyman"". Visually, the film is beautiful. Mars has been done before in a few other films, but Scott and company managed to make it look unique again. Beautiful dusty red vistas and mountains pop on screen, bringing the red planet to life. No easy feat when you have to find a place on Earth that looks completely alien. My only complaint about this film, and it is a minor quarrel, is that there is about fifteen to twenty minutes where Damon is completely absent. This isn't a big issue since what we are given is very interesting, but it is a notable absence, none the less.

5.0,"A+  After Ridley Scott has been kind of hated for his more recent films of The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, this film reminds me how brilliant Ridley Scott can be as a director because this is my favorite movie of 2015 so far. Firstly, the acting in this film is fantastic with Matt Damon pulling off one of his best performances of his entire career. Not just Matt Damon is fantastic, but all the supporting all-star cast deliver great performances and what's so special about every character is that they all are important to the story and each character has enough screen with no actor being wasted in their roles. Ridley Scott and the visuals team gave such a beautiful and break-taking view at Mars that we haven't seen before that makes this such a beautiful film to look at and experience. With this film being over 2hr 30min long and most of the film taking place with one person on a deserted planet. I was so invested and sucked into the film for how great the acting for this character was. The biggest compliment that I can say is that this film is actually a fun and hilarious movie at the same time being a dark and disturbing movie. The Martian could have easily been a miserable and mopey of a man stuck on Mars but with how much charisma Matt Damon has and everyone else, this film has hilarious comedy that makes The Martian so much better and entertaining. Such a inspiring film where it's man vs nature in Mars completely and the fight to survive on a planet where nothing grows. This film just keeps getting better and more entertaining as it went on with not just giving like everyone says Cast Away meets Apollo 13, but a film where Science is the way to survive for Matt Damon's character and science is explained and presented in such a entertaining and interesting. The film never get's boring, it keeps you at the edge of your seat wishing for Matt Damon to survive. If your a fan or learner of Science, your going to love and learn more while watching this film. The Martian absolutely lived up to the hype with great direction, acting, writing, score, visuals, cinematography, suspense, thrills, comedy and so much more to positives to say. Better than Interstellar and Gravity combined and it shows that Ridley Scott will always forever make great movies. A film everyone should see, love and just be happy that they finally saw such a great film. For sure might even being the best film of the year.

4.5,"The Martian is a masterful piece of cinema helmed by Ridley Scott, with a stellar cast holding its own as well as led by Matt Damon. Damon himself is a highlight of the film, portraying Watney exactly as he would be pictured by any reader of Andy Weir's novel. The supporting cast, with Chastain, Pena, Stan, and Bean particularly notable, also captures the feel of the novel. The story barely deviates from the book and when it does is usually not significantly different. Also, it has some of the best special effects of the year and certainly is a contender for many Academy Awards in my eyes (as they usually nominate at least one big space film a year). An enjoyable, fun, and very well-put-together flick that is one of the best of the year.",Seth S,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Jun 15, 2015",Seth S,/user/id/969645767,RT,969645767,,The Martian

4.5,"It seems there's now a new trend in the film industry to be realized at this point after a few years of successful narratives going out of this world from one's journey. It started with ""Gravity"" in 2013 when Sandra Bullock was stranded in Space and it's important for her to reach a working craft that's orbiting around Earth and land home. A year later, Christopher Nolan released a post-Dark Knight masterpiece ""Interstellar"", which launches Matthew McConaughey, with Anne Hathaway tagging along, to journey through unexplored space to search for a new home for humanity. Now for this year's space story comes from a source material by Andy Weir under the adapting direction of Ridley Scott (""Alien""), ""The Martian"". This film is at the same entertainment level as the previous two cinematic space missions, but it's the most enjoyable on its own footing.

""The Martian"" sets place in the slightly futuristic 2030s, chronicling astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) working on surviving a stranded life on planet Mars after being thought dead and left behind with what's left. The mission of his crew has now become a solo mission for him to survive and grow his own crop until a solution rises that'll managed to get him home with the help of NASA back on Earth after he'd finally got in contact with them. The film spans nearly two years of Watney surviving on Mars and impressing everyone on Earth with his unique survival story while NASA tries to get him home, with Watney's crew notified on his surprising status. They will try anything to bring him home where it's more suitable, despite an educational experience as a survival test.

""Gravity"" benefits from the thrills and cinematographic direction, while ""Interstellar"" benefits from Nolan's masterful taste in originality and visionary at an epic scale. For ""The Martian"", this sci-fi is actually calmer, even it's thrilling with gripping moments - as they can't be left out when it'll be against the atmosphere's rules - when it provides humor to lighten any sudden complications that heightens the current situation. It's part of the film's beneficial craftsmanship on the tone and the intellect survival skills displayed, as well forms of communications and occasional elegancy in music (ironically criticized by the characters in a joking friendly matter). The intellect craftsmanship is what makes this sci-fi space story with the most probable accuracy the most enjoyable than the other two.

Not only the craftsmanship, but the performances from the great cast contributes to the film's ranking position. As Matt Damon's performing at his best when displaying the survival skills with some humor added, he's greatly supported by Jessica Chastain (""Interstellar"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty""), Chiwetel Ejiofor (""12 Years a Slave""), Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña (""Ant-Man""), Kate Mara (""Fantastic Four""), Sebastian Stan (""Captain America"") and Sean Bean. They all performed nicely and contributed to the film's cheerful spirit and heart. Damon stands out above the cast's ranks, and he's definitely an Oscar contender for Best Actor (even though Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be attracting more Oscar Buzz in ""The Revenant"" - seems to be a tough competition).

I honestly haven't read the book yet when I'd planned on reading it before the seeing it on the silver screen. I'm still planning on reading it when I got the time, and I know without a doubt that it's a really good read as I also heard it's excellent. If the movie's that good, then I know it's faithful to its source material. So if you've read the book and enjoyed it, then you'll enjoy the movie more. But if you haven't read the book and you still planning on treating the movie as a typical moviegoing experience, then you can be assured that it won't be a waste of time as it's a worthy experience to see on the big screen.

5.0,"The Martian was a film I was rooting for, the trailers were amazing and I was just hoping this would be a comeback for Ridley Scott. The Martian is a great movie that is just so good I find its hard to describe. This film has one of the best casts I've seen in a while, Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Micheal Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Jeff Daniels, Kirsten Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean. Everyone was amazing in this movie, especially Matt Damon who carries this film with his best and most likeable peformance. He's so brilliant and funny and just a really likeable character you are rooting for. This film is brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott and it's his best film since Black Hawk Down. However probably the stand out of this film is the amazing screenplay by Drew Goddard. The writing for this film is just amazing, it's so funny and all the dialogue feels so natural. There's a brilliant conversation between Chiwetel Ejiofor and a woman who's name I forget but was brilliant, when they get a message. It's just so funny and natural. Goddard has really outdone himself here. The cgi is brilliant, the music is amazing, especially a bit that plays during a surgery scene. This film is also really funny, it wasn't constant laugh out loud but it was very funny. This film has a really tense third act that had me on the edge of my seat. I also loved how there was no villain. This film also looks gorgeous, it's a visual treat and absolutely gorgeous to watch. If I had any problems some of the scenes on earth at the start of the movie were a bit slow as I always wanted to get back to Matt Damon. However as the film went on I got more and more invested in the earth scenes. However the Martian is a smart, funny and ridiculously entertaining film. It's much better than gravity and a bit better than interstellar. This is a near masterpiece and one of the best movies of the year.

4.5,"The Martian is one of the finest examples of what a Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster should be. Smart, entertaining, funny and bolstered by the outstanding performance of Matt Damon and the whole supporting cast, this Ridley Scott delivery is a most welcome return to form for the esteemed director after the disappointing Exodus: Gods and Kings.
The story is pretty simple and it serves as a perfect showcase (and possible Oscar aspirations) for Matt Damon. When a Martian storm forces a team of astronauts to evacuate the planet, Damon is left behind and considered death. Shortly after that it becomes clear that he is alive and it is only up to him and his inventiveness to stay alive. As of this moment The Martian becomes a tensed sci-fi drama in which the fight with the time is mixed with good humor, stunning visuals and extremely pleasing supporting performances by Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
Of course, comparisons with other sci-fi classics such as Interstellar and Gravity are inevitable. When it comes to pacing The Martian is slower than Gravity, but this slower pace helps Damon to shine. In comparison to Interstellar, Ridley Scott's movie is funnier, more mainstream and clearly less philosophic. Yet, Damon could not quite bring the impactful performance which Matthew Mcconaughey.
In conclusion, The Martian is almost a classic and definitely a must see delivery. Sadly, what deprives it from reaching the level of Interstellar or Gravity is in the details. If an experienced viewer is more focused he/she would certainly notice some plot issues and sequences which do not match the overall realism level which is expected from the story. Nevertheless, The Martian is a top delivery and certainly one of the best movies of 2015 !",Maksim B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Jun 13, 2015",Maksim B,/user/id/900983430,RT,900983430,,The Martian

Oh and by the way, you can tell any story you want about the adventurous and tortuous lives of historical greats, but nothing will ever compare to the journey that the main character undertook in Mars.

4.0,"The Martian is one of the few films based on a novel where I've actually read the novel first and can judge accordingly. As usual, the novel turns out to be far better than the movie, mostly because reading through Watney's struggle page by page, day by day, with few if any details left aside makes it seem far more real and far less abbreviated. These criticisms aside, Ridley Scott's sci-fi survival thriller is an admirable adaptation of the novel. Matt Damon, one of Hollywood's golden boys, is charismatic and witty enough to pull off the title role while a slew of other high-profile cast members fill out the rest.

5.0,"Space Movies are movies that really thrill us in the edge of our seat. But one space film has blew me away all the way through. It's called The Martian. Director Ridley Scott's film version of Andy Weir's 2011 best-selling novel is flat-out entertainment for all movie-lovers. Matt Damon gives one of his career-best performances in one of the year's very best films. The film's length of 142 minutes may sound long, but it's worth it.

During a mission on Mars, NASA astronaut/botanist Mark Whatney (Damon) is presumed dead on the Red Planet and left behind by his crew (Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Askel Hannie) under the command of NASA commander Melissa Lewis (a unique Jessica Chastain), during a fierce storm. Whatney survives and is now all alone. He has supplies to barely help him survive. He now has to use manure as fertilizer to help grow food on a planet where nothing grows. He also has to listen to disco music recommended by Lewis.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA discovers satellite photos of Whatney still being alive. International groups of scientists are working on a solution to bring him home. The head of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor and Mitch Henderson (Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean), and NASA spokeswoman Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) are also working on solutions. The world is in shock for hope of Whatney returning.

The Martian is well-done by Ridley Scott. The director had some huge misses over the years (Robin Hood, The Counselor, and Exodus:Gods and Kings), but this is his huge epic comeback. It may not top the genius levels of Alien, Gladiator, and Black Hawk Down, but The Martian is able enough to be a huge science fiction classic.

The visual effects are astonishing, The cinematography is flat-out wonderful, and the production design is great on making it look like Mars. Drew Goddard's script is funny, smart, and awesome. Andy Weir must be proud of this joyride of a movie.

The all-star cast in the movie is great and wonderful but this is Damon's movie. Matt Damon has never been better. The actor you know as Will Hunting in his Oscar-winning film Good Will Hunting, Private James Ryan in Saving Private Ryan, and of course the unforgettable Jason Bourne in The Bourne Trilogy, but this would have to be listed as one of his greatest roles. I hope Damon gets an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for this performance because if he doesn't, the Oscars are wrong.

The Martian is an epic comeback for Scott and Damon. It's hard to not fall in love with this movie. It's so far the year's best science fiction movie. It's unforgettable, funny, unique, and the best space movie in years. The space movie everybody has been waiting for. More entertaining than Apollo 13, better than Gravity, and more great than last year's terrible space movie Interstellar. The Martian makes Interstellar's visuals look like crap. The Martian ranks with one of the year's best and should be marked as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.

5.0,"""The Martian is another strong piece of science fiction from director Ridley Scott. It is a triumph""
Movie Review: The Martian
Date Viewed: October 3 2015
Directed By Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Prometheus, Thelma & Louise, Blade Runner, Matchstick Men and American Gangster)
Screenplay By Drew Goddard, Based on the novel by Andy Weir
Starring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig,
Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan,
Sean Bean, Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover.

It is easily one of the year's best films. ""The Martian"" is another strong piece of sci-fi from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator). It is a triumph. It is about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars after getting hit by debris during a fierce storm. In order to stay alive, he must use his knowledge to grow a potato-farm on the red planet. This task is so impossible, the astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) says, ""I got to science the $&@? out of this"". Not only does Damon give another terrific performance, he has to carry most of the movie's weight. Damon, director Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) have made a movie that will not only satisfy space fanatics but also mainstream audiences and fans of Mr. Scott who have been disappointed with his last two movies (The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings).

Based on the book by Andy Weir, ""The Martian"" is set in the future where meet a group of astronauts led by engineer Mark Watney (Damon) and mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). The Ares III crew are here to conduct experiments and find samples from the red planet to bring back home but when a massive Martian storm hits the base and the crew, Watney gets hit by debris and is presumed dead by his crew who are forced to abandon the planet and the mission for their own safety.

Watney survives the storm but his crew and the Ares III ship left him behind and he is unable to make contact with NASA. After checking all the food on the base he has left, he calculates that he only has 300 days of food. He also records a series a video logs to maintain his condition and status on the red planet even though it is going to be a long time before anyone comes to rescue him.

Reviewing satellite images from the red planet, Mars mission director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) realizes that Watney is still alive and he immediately informs NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) about this shocking news. Sanders says that he has no rescue plan in place for Watney and he thinks the Ares III crew should focus on their own mission, coming back home to Earth.

Watney contacts NASA with a Mars space rover that was defunct since 1997 and he is now able to send and receive messages.
With not enough food for him to survive on Mars, Watney decides to grow a potato-farm on the central room of the base. How does he grow potatoes on Mars? It's something that's brown but I won't give away what it is. When a severe accident on the airlock of the base wipes out a majority of Watney's projected food supply, the Ares III change course and take on a risky mission to return to Mars and get Watney out of the planet.

Ridley Scott has out together an amazing ensemble cast, each of the supporting players get their moment to shine. The supporting cast includes Daniels, Chastain, Ejiofor, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Kristen Wiig as the NASA spokesperson. Even though he already played a stranded astronaut in ""Interstellar"", Matt Damon is much more grounded here as he gives one of his best performances. 
In his nearly 40-year tenure as a great filmmaker, ""The Martian"" is Ridley Scott's best movie since ""Gladiator"".

4.5,"Basic: Based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir.  It set in the future, which it doesn't show us the date of this future. The N.A.S.A. crew, which are also known as Ares 3: Mark Watney, the botanist, (played by Matt Damon), Melissa Lewis, the captain of her crew, (played by Jessica Chastain), Major Rick Martinez, (played by Michael Pena), Beth Johansson, the technician, (played by Kate Mara), Chris Beck, the flight surgeon, (played by Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel, the German astronaut, (played by Aksel Hennie) are seen from Mars. While, they're there, they start doing a whole bunch of experimenting, sampling, and researching things they've discovered in that planet. But, suddenly, there was a sandstorm, or debris, which was coming in their way. They all had to evacuate, and aboard the mission. While, the crew we're heading to their spacecraft, a piece of an antenna lands on Mark Watney, and the crew loses him, when that happened. So, then, they left him behind, presuming that he's dead, and take off.
 
The next morning on Mars, Mark Watney is still alive, and even though, he was wounded from the chest, he quickly healed it. Now, since, he realized that his crew has left him behind, and believing not only his crew, but everybody on earth, think he's dead, he's going to use all of his scientific skills to survive Mars, and also, finding a way to contact N.A.S.A, so they can come here, and rescue him.

What's the deal: The Martian is kind like Robinson Crusoe on Mars, because of its storyline, but it also goes on this comedy level like Argo, and Guardians of the Galaxy, and some similar themes to Cast Away. I was really happy that Ridley Scott was doing another science fiction film. I'm not saying that he hasn't done a science fiction film in a long time. I mean, he did Prometheus like three years ago, but, the fact is, when Ridley Scott does a science fiction film, he never makes a disappointment. Even though, Prometheus wasn't one of his best films, I did like it for its performances, and its gloomy visuals. As for The Martian, it's actually much better than Prometheus. His direction is at its best. He's just a really good visual artist. He just loves making great settings, and beautiful designs around his films, which was one of the main things to why I really like about his work. But, there we're some other things that I was more impressed than his direction. 

The first thing that I want to go on about this film is the writing. It's screenplay by Drew Goddard, and I have to say, that he is one of the most talented writers to be around. I've always been impressed by some of his previous work. He previously wrote the screenplay for Cloverfield, and I thought it was smartly written, for the most part. Then, he directed his first film: The Cabin in the Woods, and recently, he created Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix. Both of them that I was actually quite impressed with. He does know how to make some solid character development. He does know how to make something humorous, and the way how he writes the story down is wonderfully done, which he does deliver those things in The Martian. Of course, this is based on a novel, but the way that he adapted the novel, and bringing the source material to life is well done.
 
The cast is wonderful. I could totally understand why Ridley Scott cast Kristen Wiig and Donald Glover in this film because since this is a part comedy, it seem like they want to bring some comedic actors to the picture. Well, actually, Kristen Wiig does play her role a little too straightforward, even though, some of her dialogues made me laugh. Donald Glover shows up like in the middle of the film, as an astronomer, who made me laugh, and I find him quite enjoyable. Jessica Chastain is great as usual. She does bring some realism to the character, that she's playing, which there is like a couple scenes from it. The part, of where she blames herself that she left Matt Damon's character behind, and she takes full responsibilities of it because she's the captain of her crew. As for the rest of the secondary, or the supporting cast, they're absolutely great. But, Matt Damon's performance, on the other hand, is the best thing out of the whole cast. I did think that he was the right choice of playing this type of character. I also notice that his character from the novel is a smart-ass, and you can totally see that from the film. I really do enjoy the cockiness, and the selfishness out of Matt Damon's character. I find myself laughing at him, when he starts acting like that. There are also times of where he's listening to a lot of disco music, which that was the main reason of why I brought up Guardians of the Galaxy earlier in my review. But there's no doubt that he does deliver some strong emotion out of this character.
 
My full opinion: The Martian succeeds for being such a humorous and thrilling film and the experience of it is satisfying enough. 9.1/10",Brandon M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Jun 08, 2015",Brandon M,/user/id/965772601,RT,965772601,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100007869619409/picture,The Martian

4.5,"The Martian is the story of a fictional NASA mission Ares III that is forced to abort during a massive storm. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris  during the evacuation and presumed dead and left on the planet. However, he didn't die and is forced to find a way to extend his supplies and create food and water and oxygen to sustain himself for the presumed 4 years before a rescue mission would arrive to get him.

Things I Liked:

Matt Damon. Damon is one of my favorite living actors today. He continues to have that all American quality and screen charisma that keeps him interesting to watch. He goes through a lot a emotional moments including: Shock, Sorrow, Fear, Joy, Anger, the list goes on. He holds your attention for the entirety of his screen time and does so with all the talent that we have come to know from Damon.

The Story. The Movie has a really interesting twist on a simple story. The moments that make it compelling are watching the process of discovery and seeing how Watney creates all the different elements that attempt to keep him alive. And then back on earth there are a tons of people doing a similar thing to figure out how to get him back. It's a really compelling story.

The Visual Elements. The film looks incredible but it also does things in a way that makes you feel like it is not outside the realm of possibility here. The ships, the rovers, the facilities, all work and they all feel like this movie could exist right now. It's really neat to look at and nothing ever feels absurd or out of place.

Things I Didn't Like:

The Size of the Elements. While the whole cast gives a lot of really good performances, it just feels like there are too many people in this film, especially in the scenes on Earth. There are about half a dozen people at NASA working together and you feel like a couple of them could be removed and the movie would almost lose nothing. Additionally it feels a hair too long and has a few too many complications. There are a lot of obstacles thrown into the picture and after a while it seems almost comical at times how many things go wrong before they get back on track.

Overall:

Overall. The movie is an amazing piece of art. The look is both incredible and believable. The cast give fantastic performances and even though it feels like there are too many people in works, no one feels like they were phoning it in or on a different level than anyone else. The story is compelling, and even though there are a few too many complications, it's still interesting from start to finish.

3.0,"The Martian is a lot of fun and is very funny. It never really tried to be unique or different. The film is described as ""Cast Away"" meets ""Apollo 13"" I agree with this but it means that it isn't exactly a brilliant new idea. It feels like it is doing the bare minimum to get to the predictable end. The zero-gravity effects help drive this point home as they take away from the film as they are not believable in the slightest. This fact is especially disappointing since it is a year after the spectacular effects of Interstellar.

5.0,"A Must-See Masterpiece!

From legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus) comes a gripping tale of human strength and the will to survive. During a mission to Mars, American astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead when he is impaled by a piece of equipment and left behind following an emergency evacuation. But Watney is still alive. Against all odds, Watney must find a way to contact Earth in the hope NASA can devise a rescue plan. The film's ensemble cast also features Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael PeÃÃ,Â±a, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

This film is absolutely riveting and amazing! Damon deserves the Academy Award for Best Actor. With a performance that is equal parts optimistic, ingenious, intuitive, and deeply infused with a dark sense of humor, Damon has never been better. I highly recommend this outstanding film!

3.0,"The Martian is a good movie, but no where near as Cast Away or Apollo 13, mainly because the movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries to be a character study, but then has to cut back to other characters and fails miserably in the third act, especially compared to Cast Away. It tries to be a space movie, but except for one or two fun scenes, doesn't have much to offer. The science seems sound, but a lot of problems with them are ignored; for example how does Matt Damon have so much oxygen supply??? There are some jokes, and while some of them pretty good, a lot of them don't really work either.

After seeing Mad Max Fury Road I stated that it was my favorite film of 2015; that was in May. Well after seeing The Martian I can say as of right now it's the best film of 2015; I hope this film gets nominated for Best Picture cuz it's an AMAZING experience. 

Right from the start the film grabs you as you pan across the Martian landscape. Ridley Scott did a masterful job with this film, and in my opinion it's his best film to date. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the film is that good. The story, the cinematography, and the performances for the entire cast were stellar!!! Matt Damon was AWESOME, it takes a special kind of actor that can keep a film interesting by mainly having dialogue with mostly himself; Tom Hanks come to mind too in Cast Away.

I can't wait to have this film in my Blu Ray library, and it's so worth it seeing it in 3D.

The acting is fabulous. Matt Damon holds the entire movie on his back. He's likeable, sarcastic and totally realistic. This might be one of his absolute best performances that he's given! The rest of the supporting cast were also amazing. Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, Donald Glover, Sean Bean. Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels and Michael Pena are all given small but important roles! They all stand out at some point and are an impeccable ensemble cast.

Ridley Scott's directing of The Martian revives his career! After 'Exodus' and the godawful 'The Counselor', Ridley Scott makes a huge comeback! His direction of The Martian is fabulous. The cinematography and CGI are also beautiful and seamless.

I loved the way The Martian was written. The suspenseful moments were genuinely suspenseful, the dramatic moments were emotional and the humorous moments were utterly hilarious. I found myself laughing the whole way through! The Martian might be one of the funniest non-comedies I've seen in a very long time.

The plot is fairly simple but complex at the same time. It uses real science to make the whole plot feel realistic. I loved watching Matt Damon discover new ways to survive on the red planet. The pacing is perfect and the 2.5 hour runtime worked flawlessly. The musical score and soundtrack were also fantastic.

Overall, The Martian was a real surprise! It's hilarious, thrilling, really clever and proves to be one of the best 2015 has to offer. See it!

4.5,"The Martian, I believe, is the comeback film for director Sir Ridley Scott after the disappointment of Prometheus and the wretchedness of Exodus: Gods and Kings. It features a cast that would be quicker for you to search up on your favourite movie database than me listing each and everyone here. But the important person is ""The Martian"" himself, Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. And to start with, this movie was absolutely golden in terms of the visuals, the comedic factor and the overall ""gripiness"" of the plot. 

There is so much to say about The Martian, but I think the first thing the viewer notices is the scenery and the visuals. The movie starts off right in the heart of Mars; and even though it's filmed in the Jordanian desert, the accuracy in which the Martian landscape is captured is absolutely gorgeous. The scientifical anomaly that is the opening storm that strands Mark on Mars is beautifully done in its scope even if the reported 150 mph winds on Mars should have just been a slight breeze. But I'm not about to use that detail to bash on the movie, rather it uses what is found in Andy Weir's source and does it absolutely beautifully. 

Now, in terms of being true to its source, there are maybe 2-3 missteps, which if you've read the book before (or after) the movie, you will notice very clearly. However, I truly believe that films should be able to stand on its own merit without having to be constantly compared to its source and The Martian's adaptation by Drew Goddard is done in a way where even though the deviations are there in the movie, you immediately let it go because of all that's going on with the film all around you. 

The performances are very good, especially the very nuanced and quite accurate portrayal of Mark Watney by Matt Damon. The jokes that made the book such a delight to read were delivered on point by Damon and honestly the movie was a lot funnier than many of the comedies that have played in theatres this year. Jessica Chastain's character portrayal of Commander Lewis was very nuanced and a perfect casting to play someone who had the range of emotions needed for first, having left Mark for dead on Mars, and then finding out that she had left her crew mate behind. Back on Earth, Jeff Daniels is in full Will McAvoy form. There really is no performance in this movie that can be at fault and were played absolutely to a tee. 

The plot itself is a rollicking affair in which the 140 minute run time does not feel long at all at any point throughout the film. The performances are excellent on Mars, on Earth and somewhere in between the two planets as well. This truly is a case which showcases why Ridley Scott is known as a great sci-fi director. It does harp back to his directorial performances of Blade Runner and Alien, and you wouldn't want to compare this to those, but it's not a million miles away.

4.5,"I underestimated this movie. I love Matt Damon, but I do NOT like too many space films likeÂ GravityÂ andÂ Interstellar, but this one was pretty good. Some parts were reallyÂ intenseÂ and had that ""edge of your seat anxiety"" to it. There were times during the film where the actors were either saying or doing something that made the audience; myself included, chuckle and laugh. Matt Damon was really the best out of theÂ entireÂ cast to make me laugh at some of his actions. He really nailedÂ it in the film. I loved the role he played. His character was all about trying toÂ surviveÂ on a planer where nothing grows, it was noting. he had toÂ surviveÂ andÂ make dieÂ with the resources and things at hisÂ disposal. He showed us (the audience) that if you have enough will-power, drive, ambition, and courage, you can surpass anything even in space. THAT IS THE ONLY LESSON IN THE MOVIE THAT MATT DAMON PORTRAYED! The entire film was in 3D, but there were not that many 3D effects in it. Granted, I felt like I was really in space & that I was right there with the cast and with Damon as well when he was alone andÂ strugglingÂ for survival. I think I KNOW why there were so many humorous scenes in the film- it isÂ becauseÂ the film is so intense and realistic that the film wantedÂ to show how some one can make the best of a terrible situation and throw a little humor in every once in a while so that the entire film is not deep and meaningful; although it was. Damon leads the cast and he leads this movie. He is not grounded. He takes it to a whole another level! He is spectacular and deserves accolades for his character's survival and for his acting capabilities in the film. Both Damon and hisÂ characterÂ of Mark Watney deservesÂ accoladesÂ galore! Same man.

First lets talk about the direction, The Martian is directed amazingly from Ridley Scott just the direction of his characters and shots and tension.

Cast Away + Apollo 13 = The Martian

It does not fuck around it gets you into the meat of things fast

Matt Damon is Fan Freaking Tastic this is one of his best performances in a Long Time.

The Supporting cast also give amazing performances from Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofer (always amazing), and Donald Glover.

Awesome Adapted Script from Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods, World War Z and Daredevil Netflix)

This movie is also really funny there were some parts i was really dying of laughter. This movie could of been depressing, but its not thanks to the Director, Script and the amazing Cast.

The Visuals were amazing

I felt like this was almost a true story at times lol that this could actually happen one day in life.

Bad
NOTHING 

Overall: I love this movie its good to see Ridley Scott make another amazing movie after the 2 crap bombs he made in the past 2 years (The Counselor and Exodus), This is up there with Alien my favorite Scott Movie and Up there with Matt Damon with The Bourne Trilogy and A Good Will Hunting.

This should also be considered for a bunch of Oscar Nominations

Like in Interstellar, he is left alone on the planet for a long period of time so there will be parts that just drag on.  In my personal opinion, Interstellar was better, but this shows what would happen in real life. And in real life, life drags on. Also, really Ridley?  Does it really need to be in 3D?

4.0,"Mark Watney: ""F**k you Mars"".

The story is about astronaut Mark Watney is separated from his party following a fierce storm and left behind after being presumed dead. But he has survived and with few supplies, he will have to rely on his own ingenuity to survive and figure out a way to Earth that he is still alive.

You can slap Ridley Scott's name on anything and everyone (including me) will go see it. It's so awesome that you still can go to the cinema today and see a new film directed by the guy who brought us Alien, now that's freaking awesome. But Ridley can be a hit or miss with the movies that he's releasing recently such as: Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, but Prometheus (In my opinion) was pretty good and I know a lot of people may not like that movie and that's okay if you didn't like it, but I did. When I first heard about The Martian being directed by Ridley Scott, I was exciting but nervous at the same time, because as I said before about Ridley being a mix bag recently. But I kept a positive and open mind, I mean this might be the film that Ridley Scott finally went back to he's roots from the good old days. 

After seeing The Martian on my first viewing I liked it, but I wasn't amazed by it. It's not until the movie actually started to grow on me as I thought about it more and more, and now after thinking about it for awhile now, I can safely say that The Martian is a great movie. Ridley Scott's back everyone.

Matt Damon plays Mark Watney brilliantly in this movie and this might actually be the best performance I've seen from Damon. He's hilarious, always positive and never gives up even when a lot of things don't go quite as planned, he always finds away. I also love how Damon's character can crack a joke there and then even when he's in this horrible situation; and to me it made he's character more relatable and likable. This is Matt Damon finest work as he was terrific in this movie.

Ridley Scott's directing in this movie was absolutely magnificent and this has to be one of he's best films in years. The movie isn't all hilarious as there were some real suspenseful scenes in this movie, but what I thought was so brilliantly well done is that Ridley Scott mixed the humor and the suspense perfectly together. Nicely done Ridley. 

The rest of cast: Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ekiofor were all freaking great in this movie. Everyone in this movie was great.

The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost me attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone. 

Now for the problems: My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character. 

Overall The Martian is absolutely worth checking out. This is Ridley Scott's and Matt Damon's best work in years. It's beautifully shot, well acted and a entertaining movie.",Matthew B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Jan 29, 2015",Matthew B,/user/id/931412053,RT,931412053,,The Martian
5.0,"THE MARTIAN is not simply a great film.  It is not simply the best film Ridley Scott has directed since 2005.  It is also one of the best films he has ever directed.  And it is, as of this writing, the best movie of 2015.  It is a captivating, exhilarating, and hopeful vision of space travel and mankind's admirable ability to go the distance and do what is seemingly impossible.   

Based on the best-selling (and, initially, self-published) novel by Andy Weir, THE MARTIAN tells the story of Mark Watney (Matt Damon), an astronaut on a manned mission to Mars who is left for dead by his crew following a devastating storm.  He must then figure out both how to signal NASA and his teammates (who have departed the planet) that he is still alive, and how to survive on this inhospitable world until a rescue mission can come for him.  This is juxtaposed with the efforts of NASA back on Earth to formulate a plan to get Watney home, as well as the efforts of his crew to potentially take part in a daring rescue of their own.  The end result is an emotional and entertaining powerhouse of the highest order, a crowd-pleaser that never panders and celebrates ingenuity and the ""can do,"" pioneering spirit that calls mankind to explore the universe. 

Up front, a few words are warranted about director Ridley Scott and his work here.  In recent years, it's become fashionable in snooty online critic circles to bash his directorial output of the past decade, and to be fair, I don't think even Scott's biggest fans would attempt to argue that the last six or seven movies he's made represent his strongest work.  However, the notion - which is popular amongst the cinematic intelligentsia - that he's become a hack, a man who makes pretty images that contain little substance underneath, is - I think - grossly unfair.  In the interest of full disclosure, I do consider myself a Ridley Scott fan, and in the last ten years I've defended even some of his lesser offerings (yes, I'm the guy who liked ROBIN HOOD... and EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS), but even taking that into consideration, the apathy (and even outright ire) some film fans have for him is baffling.  

If nothing else, THE MARTIAN is a full-throated response from Scott to his detractors, and it demonstrates that he's not just coasting on his considerable visual prowess.  The movie is the work of a director fully-engaged with the material and directing the hell out of it.  There is a tangible feeling of wonder and awe at the sight of the Martian vistas, just as the sequences based entirely on character interaction are staged with great energy, and it is truly the character work that sets this movie apart and elevates it to the level of greatness.  Most of Scott's best films are those that offer intensely visceral or intellectual experiences, but THE MARTIAN is deeply warm and emotionally-affirming, and it is probably the most human movie he's yet made.  Of course, that he has his strongest screenplay since KINGDOM OF HEAVEN at his disposal certainly helps, too. 

Said screenplay is courtesy of Drew Goddard, a writer with a strong sense of tone, and he brings that to his work here.  The script is masterful in the way it contains lots of science-y jargon and exposition (all of which feel incredibly plausible, though - not being an engineer or a physicist - I'm not really qualified to judge how accurate it really is), but Goddard presents this material in surprisingly compelling ways.  Goddard also balances a variety of moods and themes with total ease; the movie is frequently incredibly funny, just as it is frequently unbelievably tense, and just as it is frequently wonderfully optimistic and inspiring.  To see so many people - across ethnicities, genders, and nations - working to solve a single problem imparts a hopeful message about the unifying power of shared humanity, and it is one of the reasons the movie has a genuine ""feel-good"" quality to it.

Though it boasts a phenomenal (and very large) cast, Matt Damon is the clear focal point and anchor of the movie, and I think simply calling it a great performance kind of underrates how good he is.  This is some of the best work Damon has ever done; his Watney is engaging and sympathetic, and Damon brings gigantic amounts of charm to the part.  The character faces a host of dire problems throughout the film, but Damon imparts a keen intellect and enormous good humor to the the role which make it virtually impossible to not pull for the guy in a big way.  This is an Oscar-worthy performance.

Damon's supported by a murderer's row of talent.  On the home front, the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Mackenzie Davis, and Benedict Wong all manage to make these people feel real, and each contributes in ways that impact both the plot and the emotional stakes.  Bean and Ejiofor, particularly, do some great and understated things with their characters.  In space, we have Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, and Sebastian Stan sketching out a believable team chemistry, and you instantly buy that these people enjoy being around each other, something that plays a big motivating factor as the movie closes in on its third act.  In short, it's an incredible ensemble.

Technically, the movie is as polished and handsome as any Ridley Scott film as ever been.  Dariusz Wolksi's cinematography captures the burnished hues of Mars in a striking way, and contrasts that with the sterile spacecraft and NASA administrative buildings.  The effects are convincing and effective.  The sound design is impressively detailed, as are the production and costume designs.  Expect most - perhaps even all - of these to be recognized come Academy Awards season, and such accolades would be richly deserved. 

THE MARTIAN is what great science fiction should look like: big ideas and sweeping visuals, yes, but yet still a story that is fundamentally about some aspect of the human condition.  It is simply a remarkable accomplishment, and an incredibly satisfying time at the movies.",Brett B,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 28, 2015",Brett B,/user/id/841042781,RT,841042781,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1567891636/picture,The Martian

3.5,"Of the recent slew of space films, ""The Martian"" is probably the most straightforward and old-fashioned, in a classic humanist adventure sort of way, but that's a good thing, and while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, Ridley Scott and company engage the audience with superb world-building, immersing the audience in an exotic environment that presents unique challenge to our main character played by Matt Damon. These challenges are intriguing, jumps back to Earth and the rescue break up the action in a good way, and the climax will have you holding your breath. It's ""Castaway"" meets ""Gravity"" and ""Apollo 13"".

5.0,"For Ridley Scott, the visionary director of such influential pictures as Blade Runner and Alien, the last few years have been challenging, full of questions regarding his ability and his place in the pantheon of great living directors. Since the 2007 critical hit American Gangster, the director's average Rotten Tomato rating for directed features has been an abysmal 46.40%, buoyed largely by the audience maligned Prometheus. With the release of last year's Exodus misfire, many wondered if Scott had lost his touch. For now at least, those critics have been silenced.

The Martian is a bit of a perfect storm (see the movie and see what I did there) type film, with a simple and audience friendly plot that falls at the perfect time. In short, Matt Damon plays Mark Watney a botanist/astronaut in the not-so-distant future, exploring Mars with his fellow ARES III crew members. A sudden storm forces an unplanned evacuation, during which Watney is left behind on Mars as his crew begins the 4 year journey back to Earth. The movie follows his struggle to survive and the efforts of those on Earth to keep him alive.

As you can probably imagine, this plot is hard not to like. In an age where Mars missions are being discussed actively even as the traditional space program wanes, The Martian has the look of an all-American, all-Earth type film, the sort to motivate interest in the space program and give a gritty, realistic look at what leaving the planet might look like. Interstellar tried for a bit of the same last year, but the serious tone and deep philosophical undertones were a bit much for the average movie watcher. The Martian aims for a greater accessibility and achieves brilliantly, delivering an intimate and moving story of survival while tying in themes of humanity united under a common goal.

It's at this point that the movie is probably takes the greatest risks. An endeavor like this can't solely survive on cinematography or storyline and without the soul wrenching questions of a film like Interstellar, this film has to rely on the humanity of its lead and his supporting cast. Without a full block of convincing performances, The Martian is just another empty science fiction film (Gravity comes to mind).

But Scott and his staff absolutely killed this casting. Damon is spectacular, delivering his best performance in years as the snarky and relatable Watney, who ""sciences the shit"" out of his predicament and is impossible to not root for. His crew is equally impressive, with the rapidly ascending Jessica Chastain masterfully managing the stern captain's role while also successfully convincing us that she is older than Damon (she is 6 years younger, but you wouldn't know it). Kate Mara and Michael Peña both prove that they can deliver in the right role and it makes my heart happy to know that Mara will actually feel like watching one of her films this year (see Fantastic Four disaster). Relative newcomers Aksel Hennie (Hercules) and Sebastian Stan (Captain America) round the crew off nicely and Hennie in particular adds an impressively powerful emotional performance through sheer presence, despite having few lines.

The ground crew is star studded as well, with Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor (sure he's famous for 12 Years A Slave but Serenity anyone?) leading the charge. Daniels fills the role of the paper pushing, budget/public relations obsessed bureaucrat surprisingly well, offering excellent matter-of-fact political monologues like he's been doing them forever. Ejiofor offers the perfect counterbalance to Daniels' character and his face continues to move us emotionally. Bean doesn't die (spoiler) and there are Lord of the Rings inside jokes. Wiig is a bit of an oddball, but her role makes it work.

Topped off with a dose of Benedict Wong, Donald Glover (Apparently great at music, television and movies now) and a supremely nerdy tech team, The Martian doesn't slip an inch in the acting department. We get to see the emotions of each team member from the littlest tech right on up to Watney and the director of NASA. Ridley Scott's use of excessive facial shots means that we see some of the most minute details. Damon gets a ton of time, but the subtle facial movements of Chastain, Ejiofor, Bean and Glover help to tie up the loose ends.

All of this ridiculously good casting won't take away from what Scott has accomplished visually. The Martian isn't quite as gorgeous as Interstellar, but Scott makes a good go at it. The landscapes are truly fantastic and the technoporn is as good as advertised. The nature of the situation allows Scott to close in on some of the most minute details of his near-future exploration gear and like Interstellar, it feels (and at times, is) possible. The shots of the Hermes, the Earth-to-Mars spacecraft, take me right back to what made Alien so great. Although the 3-D version of the film isn't Avatar good, Scott cleverly uses the technology to give scenes special depth and intimacy. The result is understated (this isn't James Cameron intentionally using 3-D to throw things at you) and subtle, but I enjoyed the results and felt my money was well spent.

Overall, The Martian isn't perfect. Some of the scenes seem a bit rushed and for Scott, the premise isn't nearly as risky as his previous works. There isn't much there philosophically either, other than the obvious mankind-united, never-alone type messages. Nevertheless, The Martian is such a watchable movie. It's got all of the basics, an excellent cast, a gorgeous visual array, a jabbing sense of humor and a thirst for adventure beyond our planet that is truly commendable. The way Scott arranges this movie allows him to tell the story in a way that makes sense to everyone while sacrificing very little in terms of quality. The results make The Martian one of the best movies of the year and certainly the funnest to watch so far.",Phillip D,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 02, 2015",Phillip D,/user/id/835284471,RT,835284471,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1384725776/picture,The Martian

3.5,"This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.

The movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.

Obviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.

A lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason alone...to be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential elections...from both sides!

There are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.

If the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f... good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.

Okay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.

As I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more.",Per Gunnar J,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Dec 16, 2014",Per Gunnar J,/user/id/915708163,RT,915708163,,The Martian
