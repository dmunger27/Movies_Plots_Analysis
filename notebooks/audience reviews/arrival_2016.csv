3.5,"Although I'm not a fan of sci-fi movies about extraterrestrials, Arrival was incredible. The story is very interesting and told in a clever way through science and politics instead of the overused premise of aliens destroying the planet for domination.

5.0,"This movie is fantastic. The performance of Amy Adams is unparalleled, and the approach to the storyline is fantastic as well. It is a cerebral movie and may have suffered from marketing as a Sci-Fi action drama, but this is deeper than a typical alien invasion shoot 'em up drama. The pieces are laid out during the first act and leave the viewer confused, trying to put them together, and when they eventually come together it snaps so neatly and satisfyingly.

The alien design and language are interesting but the fact that she knowingly gives life to her daughter just to lose her to cancer years later makes me and usually the majority of people (especially those who have kids) furious.

3.5,"Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.

'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse?

Back to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.

The criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.

Forest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.

However, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.

Johann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.

In terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.

The acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.

All in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Kyle E,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Mar 18, 2022",Kyle E,/user/id/965732148,RT,965732148,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100008237642228/picture

5.0,"I feel strongly that this film is a masterclass in film-making, as it is able to merge the epic scope of the sci-fi genre, with a story that ultimately centres around motherhood.
Without spoiling the film, I'd summarise it as an
exploration of the human condition and what it means to be a mother, wrapped under the guise of an alien blockbuster. On a cinematic level, this film is near perfect. Denis Villeneuve manages to create a synthesis of the real-world environment with excellent CGI, creating a more grounded,
realistic alien film that isn't very common. The score is unbeatable, with the heart-wrenching melody of Max Richter's ""On the nature of daylight"" swelling in the epilogue, emphasising the heart-wrenching climax of the film.
Of course, Amy Adams is superb (as always), as she so fluently, pardon the pun, portrays a confident linguist who creates a realistic balance between her career and her motherhood. This is an incredible character that Amy Adams fantastically portrays. Jeremy Renner is great too,
as is Forest Whitaker, but Amy Adams is definitely the star here.
To conclude, I implore you to watch this film! It is
groundbreaking, as it has not only completely redefined the sci-fi genre for me, but it has reshaped my philosophy regarding mortality and love, and made me think of things in different ways. The film forces you to delve deep into
your own life, it forces you to confront your feelings and your regrets, yet you're never taken out of the film - you remain completely immersed in Villeneuve's frighteningly authentic world. I never expected a film that on the surface seemed to be about the arrival of aliens, to instead stir my
emotions in a way that very rarely happens with a film.",Ari Y,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Feb 12, 2022",Ari Y,/user/id/979471303,RT,979471303,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1324706534659401/picture

5.0,"HEAVY SPOILERS
An impressively complex yet comprehensive Science Fiction/Thriller story that doubles as a commentary on the importance of language. As foreshadowed by the protagonists Louise (Amy Adams) initially interaction with her co-lead Ian (Jeremy Renner) this is an exploration on the universal necessity of communication between sentient creatures. This is inclusive of not only humans and aliens but of humanity itself. The film also successfully presents an argument for why language is the most important weapon. Not to hurt or destroy but to defuse a conflict and mutually benefit everyone. Several factors come into play that raise the stakes of the movie. The first is the inability to communicate which plays out a number of different ways among the nations. Fear and paranoia are exploited by both the media and internet personalities which leads to protests and an assassination attempt later in the film. Pressure is placed on the governments to give answers they don't have. Thus tensions are placed on relationships between the military authority and Louise which slowly escalates and crescendos at the end and almost results in the death of our protagonists. The next factor is miscommunication which plays out as the alien language translating to ""gift weapon"" to each major location the aliens landed. This causes mistrust and fear between the world powers and they cut off communication for each other. Slowly but surely they begin to mobilize against the aliens believing them to want planetary control. Louise frantically tries to deescalate the situation to no avail. She knowing communication is the best way to solve this and believing the aliens to be friendly takes matters into her own hands and goes to talk to the aliens herself. Entering the chamber she  exposes herself to their atmospheric accommodations and talks face to...head? With one of the aliens whom she has come to know. She learns that they do indeed wish to gift them all a weapon but the weapon is not a scientific advancement or a destructive tool of conquest. Each power was given a piece of their language. Before departing Louise is given their entire language by the alien and when she returns she realizes she can understand it. She also begins to realize something else. Throughout the film we see what we thought were flashbacks to Louise's life and the death of her daughter. But it turns out that the film utilizes the theory that language determines the way your brain thinks and see's the world. Using this they introduce the concept that the alien language is a palindrome. Its the same backwards as it is forwards. Because of these things Louise is not having flash backs but flash forwards due to her increasing exposure to their language. Now she is able to see how everything in her life will play out and manipulate time to gain access to the phone number of the leading force of hostility towards the aliens. Using language she is able to reach him in an emotional place due to her ability to hear what she said in the future and prevent the attack on the aliens. Using only her words and the capabilities of language she prevents a major military conflict. The film wraps up with a corny but cute ""I wouldn't change a thing"" moment that is flipped on its head between our two leads as Louise is literally choosing to not change a single decision she has yet to make. However I will say she is able to see her own divorce in the future and it is implied she allowed things to happen the same way so that leaves me questioning why she would choose to go down the same path and not try and prevent it. But I suppose she can only remember the future not feel it in the moment so perhaps the nuance is that she has fallen in love with him currently and knows someday things won't be the same and she will fall out of love. It is human nature to do something that you desire despite knowing it will only end in pain so I suppose it does make sense but it also could be because she wants to experience the existence of her daughter and all the love and happiness that she has brought but also has yet to bring. Brings up a lot of ethical questions of selfishness and selflessness, is she being selfish in going down the same path or selfless in giving her daughter life even for a short time. Either way this is a movie that rewards thinking and knows how to subvert expectations in a satisfying way. In addition it presents a compelling argument about language and an entertaining exploration of a potentially possible scenario someday. I just wish the visuals weren't so cold and gray. It felt very bleak and for me that just makes it less appealing to ever revisit. But things are rarely perfect and this was still a hit on the nail for me.

4.0,"A dazzling sci-fi epic that creates a beautiful spectacle on such a grand scale out of the mere arrival of extraterrestrial visitors. The arrivers feel truly.....well...alien. Their mysterious presence and the tense build-up to their arrival is expertly handled. The characters trying to learn and understand their unique language in an effort to communicate with them was fascinating to watch unfold. The discoveries and tension keep building up until they come to fruition in an amazing climax. Amy Adams is sympathetic, albeit a bit on the meeker side for someone who's such an accomplished scientific figure. But still an engaging performance nonetheless. My only major issue is the ending resolution, where it's revealed that (SPOILERS!) Amy Adams's character knew that her daughter was going to die of cancer and cause her husband to leave in grief, yet still chooses to go along with it anyway because it's ""worth it"". Which is frustrating, because I could easily see this working if this was the only way she could preserve peace between Earth and the aliens via those time visions she received. But the movie implies that she still has the choice to not go through with it. That she merely chooses to do so out of some forced attachment to an imaginary daughter that she only saw for a couple of visions, some of which involved her in immense pain and grief during her final years of life. It almost comes across as some unsettling warped pro-life angle to this messed up scenario. Why give someone life if you know they're going to die a horrible death in their youth and cause so much misery? Why not just adopt? There's not even abortion involved, it's just the absence of procreation. And this all could've been avoided if they just implied that this had to happen, that this wasn't her choice. It would've made the ending that mirrors the beginning so much more powerful with the movie's themes about time being a circle. I know it's just one flaw, but it's a major one that really drags down the movie's otherwise fantastic score for me. Regardless, the visual artistry and alien linguistics plotline more than make up for the movie's drawbacks.

5.0,"""Despite knowing the journey… and where it leads… I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it.""

Now Denis wanted to talk to aliens. I remembered watching this in the theater and was surprised that it wasn't actually about alien invasion. Just like the previous movies, the second time viewing with some prior understanding made me appreciate this piece of art. 

The music and cinematography resolved so well with each other. Whenever the characters came into the spacecraft, it was an entirely immersive, quiet, yet slightly intense because I, like the characters, were stepping into the unknown. Like Enemy, the whole scenes were filled with one blue color, creating a sad yet again immersive tone. 

Just as immersive was the performance by Amy Adams. Her character had to deal with a trauma while talking to these aliens. Such sadness filled her face, as well as the voiceover. 

This time Denis explored the dual nature of language. It can divide as well as unite people. It's a weapon as well as a gift. Denis cleverly reaffirmed the main purpose of language as a gift by capitalizing on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Not only that, this usage also became a way to beautifully explore the nature of time and apply it to build Amy Adams's character and how she confronted her trauma. I just loved how everything seamlessly coalesced and nothing felt forced.

Besides that one exposition scene that explained the nature of writing and language, I don't have any problem with this movie.

Overall, a beautiful, emotional, and immersive movie with a daring theme about a common tool that can unite us all. 9.5/10",Nguyen D,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 21, 2021",Nguyen D,/user/id/977479849,RT,977479849,

4.5,"Some claim that Denis Villeneuve is the new Christopher Nolan. Admittedly, both clearly have a drive for the extraordinary. But a look beneath the surface shows that the two directors can hardly be compared. While Nolan repeatedly overdoes it with his penchant, as he did most recently with Tenet, Villeneuve's Arrival shows that, as a presumed Nolan counterpart, he takes a completely different approach. In contrast to Nolan's repetitive brainfuck, the Canadian created what is arguably one of the most intelligent sci-fi films of recent years.

What Villeneuve clearly has ahead of Nolan is his knack with the ensembles in his films. No actress could have embodied the lead role of linguist Louise Banks better than Amy Adams. Although Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are also likable in the supporting roles of a physicist and military colonel, Adams carries the film single-handedly. The character is fragile and conflicted from the start, and because of intimate glimpses into her private and thought life, we always know why that is. The way Adams manages to suggest this rollercoaster ride of emotions is quite great. She usually has barely seconds to catch her breath before she has to move on from profound thoughts about her deceased daughter back to the mysterious enigma of the aliens landing on Earth. Even the way Adams behaves in some scenes while trying to communicate with the mysterious beings is comprehensible. You immediately want to join her and assist in the difficult research. This makes for a complex film character with numerous facets that you can empathise with at all times. Yes, Adams often plays the broken woman with a dark past. Only in Arrival she certainly doesn't always come across as an emotional wreck, but rather determined and enthusiastic about her responsibility despite her stroke of fate. Jeremy Renner's character, the physicist Ian Donnelly, is a nice touch and shares many interesting scenes with Louise. However, he is overshadowed by Adam throughout. This has little to do with Renner's performance, which is excellent as always, but the character simply lacks complexity. The same applies to Whitaker's Colonel Weber, who, after an initially strong presence, plays second fiddle more and more as time goes on. This is also less due to Whitaker's acting than to the lack of X-factor in his character.

So why is Arrival now so much more thoughtful and better than, say, Tenet? Villeneuve shows such a fine hand in his directing that the film never comes across like one of the many forced sci-fi flicks with mega effects and explosions, but rather resembles a slowly told thriller. Not because there is so much suspense, Arrival is no Sicario by any means, but until the end you don't know what the aliens' intention is and to what extent the protagonist's life plays a role. The final leaves you stunned, amazed and above all overwhelmed. Despite a few hangs in the middle, Arrival is another Villeneuve masterpiece with which the best director of our time revolutionised science fiction with his unique signature.",Severin D,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 06, 2021",Severin D,/user/id/978882112,RT,978882112,
4.0,"Denis Villeneuve is one of the outstanding directors working today, consistently producing brilliant films one after the other, but Arrival may just be his most heartfelt to date.

His direction is fantastic by taking the sci fi genre and giving it new light. This film is all about communication and how language impacts how we live life, so by conveying this message through the use of aliens invading earth (a cliche narrative choice with Sci Fi) Villeneuve is risking being ordinary, but becomes an original, imaginative filmmaker in the process.

The film has excellent performances from Amy Adama and Jeremy Renner, alongside it's beautiful cinematography and soundtrack shot by Bradford Young and composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson respectively. The incredible screenplay via Eric Heisserer puts the cherry on top. An all round complete picture.

The film has many deep meanings which would suggest multiple viewings are essential in understanding the films complete idea, but Arrival is an underrated gem in my opinion and highlights Villeneuve's status as one of Hollywood's prominent directors working today.

The story's beauty transcends the science fiction genre as a meditation on moral dilemma while never forgetting its roots.

The one thing that surprised me the most about Arrival is how meticulously crafted it is, how ambitious it is, and how powerful Amy Adams' performance is.

3.5,"It was interesting, but I wouldn't say I was touched by the morale like everyone seem to. I think that, yes, it is a good reflection on the humanity and the need of language, how languages define someone, but I didn't feel so much emotions. I was surely not the fault of the main actress who was super, but maybe it is the fact that, for me, there was no real sad moments. Also, I would say the end disappointed me a bit because it was really complicated and I'm not sure I understand everything. On the other hand, the end solves a problem that I found during the movie. Indeed, maybe you'll find the movie chaotic with his timeline, but the end explains everything. Now, the movie has great points too, not just bad. I would say that it goes in a better direction than a lot of sci-fi movie with this ""Aliens psychology"" sort of thing and it exploit a much different and deep subject into the alien touch. Also, the images a pretty good. I really liked the dark environment and the mist everywhere, it was visually well-done.

Near the end of the movie we find out that the ill daughter flashbacks are actually the future visions which is fine but the fact we never find out what's the big thread that aliens need human help in 3000 years, is quite a letdown.

4.5,"""Arrival"" é inovador, mesclando conceitos ambíguos a uma premissa talvez antes nunca explorada, subvertendo tudo que esperávamos sobre o longa.

A atmosfera do filme é muito bem construída aqui, moldando o plot desde a primeira cena do filme. A subversão dos até então ""flashback's""; a elegância da fotografia, respeitando muito bem as magnitudes, o que deixa claro que esse filme foi feito para telões; o background da trama é bem definido pelos telejornais, o que gera uma influencia grande da trama, tanto nos acontecimentos quanto na nossa percepção dos acontecimentos. A OST é magnifica, tanto no conjunto como no clímax.

A compreensão do tempo é muito bem representada aqui, com um plot inteligente e uma abordagem como eu disse acima, inovadora. Enfim, todos esses fatores - e muito mais - tornam a experiencia incrível. É um filme essencial para os fans do gênero.

3.0,"Arrival is a movie that will make you feel nervous and intense BUT, I expected more. 

Arrival is a movie that I really enjoyed, the first act of the movie made me excited, want to see more and want to know what will happen at the end, to be more specific, I wanted an answer to the question ""why are they here?"", and the first act builds that so well.

Amy Adams' (plays: Dr. Louise Banks) performance was absolutely incredible and so powerful, loved her character and her acting was amazing, her face expressions, body language, and her eyes are everything, she was acting with everything. Forest Whitaker (Plays: Colonel Weber) was also amazing, very cool performance that surprised me. Jeremy Renner's character (Ian Donnelly) was so useless, even the character said that in one of the scenes, he said that he is nothing without Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and she is the one who is doing everything.

The directing was so amazing wasn't surprised that Denis Villeneuve was nominated for an Oscar. 

The cinematography and colors were so amazing, especially that shot when we first see the aliens aircraft, the incredible long take encompassing the entire area with the fog surrounding it, loved it so much. One thing that grabbed my attention is the whole ""color tone"", the off white-ish color that is dark, gives u that feeling of fear, feeling of confusion of why these aliens are here, it was just amazing and really loved it so much.

The music was so cool, it builds a lot of emotions inside of you.

the production design was so beautiful and simple, deserved an Oscar nomination.

The sound editing and sound mixing were two things that were really powerful and although I didn't watch that movie on the big screen with all the sound effects that are in the theatre, but it was still a thing that was so amazing and grabbed my attention.

Arrival is a movie that is not the best but also not the worst, the 3rd act or to be specific; the ending makes you want to watch the movie again and makes you think about the movie from its begging. A great story with a great directing, cinematography and production design but felt like it could've been way better but 
For sure recommend it.

5.0,"So glad it took the overdone alien first contact action flick and added a realistic setting. Highly grounded in sci-fi is what makes this one of my favourite films.

Rewatched it for the first, after 3 years. Remember vividly a lot of stuffs, one the few movies I used to constantly think about 3 years ago. Script is a masterpiece, way to tell that story in that way, beautiful. The concept of time travel seen in a new light.

The soundtrack is addicting, was listening to it out loud and my mother told me to stop it because it felt like 'someone was dieing', I replied HannaH.

The cinematography of that first scene of spaceship was gorgeous. Many social commentary about conspiracy theory, majority of them were correct as we can see from pandemic. I actually gained a lot of respect for linguistics, always thought of it as a useless study area but boy was I wrong.

Rewatching it, caught many foreshadowing. The movie literally says everything at the beginning.

Loved the themes, her taking the decision of have that child. Its not about the goodbyes but the memories we make before the goodbyes. She would rather find & lost than never get it. The parallelism with one the heptapods(alien) dieing yet the other one not caring because their time isn't linear, they could go back in memory.

Script was smart to have that Chinese official scene, many will say it was plot convenience but I have head canon of her later telling the Chinese official to tell her everything later on, hence he had a line 'I don't know how your brain/memory works'

The movie did answer why aliens came but it wasn't concerned with that,  it was more about humanity and their perspective & memories. This is CINEMA.

This movie is so intense and full of meanings, to me, that since the first time I have put it at my top 3. The fact is that, if does any chance of an alien contact sometime or anytime, I wish it happened like that.

Even if the movie were devoid of the ridiculous ""future sight"", advanced aliens should be smart enough to send some innocuous probes to record & decipher human communication, then send messages to us instead of hovering mysteriously & menacingly over Earth.

Don't go into the film excepting big laser battles and action because this is a slow-paced film. That's one little criticism I have with this film. It's a little slow.

4.0,"I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present.

Arrival reminds us of that, taking one the basic concepts of humanity - language and communication - and turning it upside down. It certainly is an intelligent movie, with good acting, directing and storytelling.
Although the images and cgi are compelling to support the plot, the cinematography is not what makes this movie excellent. It is how the images are used, and the many little details that support the overall tone and emotions, letting you feel what our protagonists feel, and playing with your emotions in a way you wouldn`t expect - making this an absolute great watch.

5.0,"This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and I'm old enough to have seen most of them. I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that.  In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life.  Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking.  It makes a statement like a philosopher.  Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important.  I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it.

4.0,"The Arrival was an incredible experience. The movie has an opposite premise compared to the other movies from its genre(Indepence Day, The War of the Worlds, etc). The Arrival parts from a premise of a friendly first contact between aliens and humans, when humans tries to develop a communication with the Heptapods.
One of the things that I have admired in this movie was its atmosphere, the way the movie makes you feel immersed, the way that the events happen, the way humanity reacts from an alien visit from the movie tries hard to make a realistic scenario and succesfully achieves it! Since the scene where Dr. Louise Banks see the news from a televion and the first time she sees the alien spaceship. The movie, once again, succesfully makes you feel immersed and uncomfortable, it makes you ask to yourself: Who are they? And what do they want?
When comes the scene which Louise and Ian are learning how to make contact with them I though that was fair. Although some linguistics affirms that one of their techniques was not one of the best, it felt realistic. More realistic parting from the assumption that the Heptapods had no difficulties in understanding them.
One of the things, I can't consider if it's a con or not, but the movie struggles to be a realistic movie, from the alien visit to including the political scenario to the movie, but in the movie China and Russia are considered the most important countries of the planet, ""each step China takes, other 12 nations will follow"". And constant references of the Venezuela were made on the movie. That part actually wrapped my stomach, no country in the planet, even USA does not have this power, I've noticed that this part tried hard to make a propaganda for their political view, that didn't fit well in the movie. Needless to say.
One of the things that caught my attention too was the camera angles, the movie began with the camera aiming at the ceiling and slowly pointing the camera to the scenario, the movie began and finished with this camera animation(this camera movement was repeated some times throughout the movie).
The Arrival has its pros and flaws, I'll give it 4/5, the only part of the movie I didn't like was that forced political view propaganda, ignoring that, was a pleasant experience.",Christian M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 01, 2019",Christian M,/user/id/978366442,RT,978366442,

5.0,"Greatly expanding upon Ted Chiang's original (and terribly titled) novella, Villeneuve's thoughtful, laconic adaptation shifts the focus ever so slightly away from the heptapods themselves and their language toward the human characters and their communicative failures. In developing the social and geopolitical implications of the alien's arrival while simplifying the actual linguistic import of the source material, the film deepens the emotional resonance of the story beyond the original text's meticulous exploration of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; instead, here the arrival of extreme alterity could just as well stand for the need to address the exigency of unthinkable climate change (incomprehensible yet demanding response) as it does the appearance of extra terrestrials. In this sense, the movie is also ultimately far more hopeful than the novella: As in the latter, we may never fully be able to communicate with the wholly Other, understanding their motives or plans, but here we can still at least learn to speak and listen to one another.",Jake C,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Oct 11, 2019",Jake C,/user/id/976528324,RT,976528324,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100158086500388/picture

5.0,"I give out five-star ratings when a movie is not just good, but is also memorable enough to leave me dwelling on it for a long long time. And boy did I not know Arrival would end up doing just that ! It's funny even thinking that I chose to watch it on Netflix just cause I was bored. But it subverted all the conventions of a typical sci-fi flick in leaving a message so beautifully surreal yet still so highly relevant to our global community. Adams (and even Renner) are amazing as always, though it is Villeneuve who is at the peak of his craft, masterfully going back and forth in between the flashbacks and Louise's present in such an emotionally impactful way. This is definitely a movie that will always be up there for me! (credits to Max Richter as well for that final song which is just pure gold)

I must add though, that there definitely are some flaws. The story isn't quite complete, and the characters of Renner, Whittaker and Stuhlbarg feel unnecessary, which wastes such high talent.

The original story by Ted Chiang is indeed in itself a work of genius that goes into detail about complex physics and linguistics while still being undeniably hard to put down for a layperson. But Villeneuve takes Chiang's work a step further by taking audiences on an emotional thrill ride, that deals with issues of diplomacy, motherhood, love, loss, science, linguistics, and the dynamics of human interaction in a seamless and intelligent way.

Arrival does some things exceptionally well while it does other things exceptionally badly.

I liked the message in the end and how it was something I really couldn't have predicted. However it all gets destroyed because almost every character except for the main character and her obligatory unnecessary lover are portraied as unintelligent, impulsive, hostile people.
Arrival has a lot of great ideas but it executes them badly.

5.0,"This is how you make a science fiction film.

Everything about Arrival is excellent. From the very first moments of contact, this scenario screams 'real'. Or, if not real, then at the very least 'plausible'.

Out of all the science fiction movies I've watched over the years, Arrival is the only one to evoke any sense of actual believability. If an alien species were to visit earth, the events portrayed in Arrival are almost exactly how I believe things would actually transpire.

All of the performances are fantastic, but Amy Adams really steals the show. Her portrayal of Louise Banks is engrossing and, again, believable. Jeremy Renner does a great job as well, but he shares so much screen time with Adams that his performance is very much understated.

I loved the sound direction for this film. I loved the sounds the aliens made, and I loved the distorted sensation that the characters were subjected to in their presence. The musical score is spot-on, as well. Tense, but not overbearing.

The aliens themselves were exactly how I would imagine aliens would actually appear: not human-like at all but, instead, strange and otherworldly and in complete defiance of anything we have ever seen.

I really enjoyed the plot of Arrival. I'm very interested in the concept of time and the flow of time and everything that it entails. The idea of an alien language being able to manipulate the flow of time is - to me - completely unique and unlike anything I'd seen or read in science fiction before. The use of flashbacks, and the eventual reveal of them being flash-forwards, was executed very well.

Arrival is one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen. It is smart, beautiful, dramatic, and thought-provoking... everything you could ask for in a movie.

Director Dennis Villenueve is a master at creating spectacular visuals and the first look at the ""shell"" in Montana was one of the greatest shots I have ever seen. Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner create spectacular performances as their characters and if they didn't, they deserve at least an Oscar nomination. Arrival also teaches you about language and how it can be messy and how you can rewire your brain into a new one when learning a new one (I am learning Spanish and this is actually true as sometimes it gets hard for me to write in English as the order of sentences are flipped around.

5.0,"This movie made me sign up for an account because it is a work of genius that needs even more praise. This is the rare sort of film that leaves me despondent because other films of its type and caliber simply do not exist.

For those who haven't seen it: STOP READING ABOUT IT. GO INTO THIS MOVIE BLIND. Do not read spoiler-laden reviews. Do not read anything about it. Avoid trailers. If you go this movie knowing anything other than its basic premise (Aliens have landed, we try to figure out what to do), you WILL regret it.

This is perhaps the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It transcends the genre, over its storyline, evolving into something much greater than what its title, box art, posters, trailers, or any marketing materials could possibly convey. Its storyline starts out a tense first-contact-with-aliens affair, but unravels into something intricate, challenging, delicate, and utterly emotionally and intellectually compelling.

Simply put: Every aspect of this movie is impeccable. As a whole composition, Villeneuve has achieved near-perfection.

I could fawn over this story's plotline forever, but it's too special to reveal much through analysis. Trust me: It's genius. It's the movie I've basically always wanted, executed brilliantly.

The two obvious stars here are Amy Adams's performance and Denis Villeneuve's direction. Adams's performance has been much-lauded, but Villeneuve's direction cannot garner enough praise.

Direction is obviously outstanding. Scenes are expertly crafted to give the audience the best-possible perspective coming from the viewpoint of the central protagonist: Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams, who got robbed of her Oscar for this performance). This is so crucial: Scenes which are disorienting for Dr. Banks are disorienting on-screen; we feel the chaos surrounding; we feel her intimate confusion. Not only does this make us empathize with her character, but, in the movie, she is an expert linguist and brilliant person. This makes us, the audience, feel intelligent. For such an intelligent film, it's a real treat.

Pacing is excellent. It starts out slow and tense, but absolutely never boring. It ramps up precisely before it needs to, steadily building up to a crescendo that's so magnificent, detailing it in praise would be close to spoiling it.

The film's bleak and minimalistic aesthetic is outstanding, with sparse set pieces and dark, muted, earthy color tones both complimenting and focusing on the aliens and their spacecraft-a work of sci-fi minimalistic perfection. It's the glorious antithesis of oversaturated Michale Bay schlock (in almost every regard, really.)

The sound design, too, is brilliant. It's subtle, but captivating. Jóhann Jóhannsson's musical score perfectly compliments the aesthetic and narrative. It serves as neither background noise nor show-stealer. The non-musical sound design, however, is often breathtaking. It is brought into and out of focus with surgical precision, maintaining sublime quality throughous. But when it's in the spotlight, it elevates this movie, becoming one of the defining traits that make this one of the greatest sci-fi films ever.

My only minor complaint is backhanded praise: that this film deserves to be longer. It could easily work with an extra 30 minutes instead of having less than 2 hours of runtime. I'm loathe to imagine what might have been cut by studio executives, but relish the idea of a Director's Extended Cut. 

When I think about other minor complaints (""this one scene, that other scene, was this a plot hole or sloppy writing?"") that popped into my head at one point or another, after digesting the film, in retrospect, every single one made sense. No other science-fiction film has required me to suspend my disbelief so little.

This film is nearly perfect. And I only say that to hedge my bet, because no imperfections come to mind. This film was a revelation. It was transcendental, monumental, and hopefully genre-defining.

The awesome plotline, pacing, aesthetic,  sound design, and acting (especially by Adams) are all precisely put together by Villeneuve to craft a cinematic art piece that is both immensely intellectually and emotionally compelling.

5.0,"- Arrival takes you out of this world and brings you home. -

After watching Arrival with my work boyfriend Ben, we had to go outside and have a smoke - and I don't even smoke.

This is one of the most intense, emotionally draining and sublime movies I have seen in YEARS. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario) excelled in making a film, not just about aliens, but the human desire to connect. It is fascinatingly complicated to explain, but this is what I would compare it to:

It's like watching a YouTube video that is narrated by a scientist as they describe how infinite space and time is and how fleeting our lives are - all whilst the most beautiful score plays in the background. I slowly fell in love with aliens and Amy Adams (Julie and Julia) and by the end of it, I questioned everything about my own existence.

I can only give a short synopsis because I don't want to reveal any major spoilers.  Here is what you need to know:

Louise (Amy Adams) is a linguistics professor who has spent her entire life studying communication. She knows about a billion different languages (don't quote me on that, it's probably more like 40). In the opening scenes of Arrival, 12 alien spaceships land all over the world and Louise is called upon to communicate with the one that landed in America. What happens next is a space roller coaster of emotion, science, math and language.

That's about all I can tell you about the plot. Not because I am lazy, but because I want you to experience what I did - going into a movie you know very little about.

So instead, I will tell you about the rest of my evening as we tried to make sense of what we'd just seen.

Ben and I sat on the bench outside the theater with our legs folded.  We gushed with mutual revelations of ""Oh god I didn't even pick up on that.""

Ben asked me ""How on Earth (pun intended) are you going to review this?"" I shrugged my shoulders and said, ""maybe I will write it in the symbols that the aliens used to communicate with humans, but then I realized I am not a linguistics expert or an alien, so that idea was quickly abandoned.

However, I feel that I am an expert in spotting talent and Amy Adams has been on my radar for awhile now. We discussed how I thought she was a great actress but the characters she's played in the past have annoyed the living crap out of me. But there was no such annoyance in sight with her portrayal of Louise in Arrival. Adams plays her exquisitely.

There is no dramatic speech about ""this is our Independence Day."" She doesn't scream and cry that the world is ending. Adams subtly and superbly plays a woman who is hiding a secret but doesn't know it. Adams is so good in fact, she had me singing ""somebody is getting an Oscar nomination"" all the way to my car.

The last thing I did with my evening was call my mum, because this movie makes you want to call your family. If you don't have a family, then it will make you call your friends. If you don't have friends, then it will make you search the skies for aliens to talk to.

Why? Because this epic Sci-Fi film is not really about the threat of aliens, it is about communication. It is about understanding each other and our differences. We are all asking the questions, do you hear me? Do you see me? Does what I am saying matter to you?

After watching Arrival, it was not a question of are we alone in the universe, it was a question of, why would we want to be? And if there is ever a day when extraterrestrials come down to Earth, if I'm still alive, then I will be the first to shake their hand - or tentacle - or whatever.

As famous philosopher Paulo Freire once said - ""only through communication can human life hold meaning"". Therefore isn't the meaning of life found through how we connect with each other, through love and understanding? (Woah, wait...did I just discover the meaning of life?)

If the aliens are only taught words related to a competitive game then they can only describe things in terms of competition.

What would a language look like if it had no limits and caused our perspective to shift in the direction of infinity?

4.5,"Arrival is a very well written story being made by great directing and acting. But the catch is you won't appreciate it until you watch it for the 2nd time. The first time I watched it, I did not like it too much because much of the imagery made very little sense for me to understand what is going on enough to appreciate the style of story telling. It did not help this is not the kind of movie with action-packed thriller to keep you interested while not knowing what is going on. But after I learned the twist towards the end from the first time, and watched it again for the 2nd time, everything became crystal clear, which finally allowed me to appreciate the brilliance in the way the director/writers chose to do the story telling. It is a pretty risky choice from commercial success stand point. But I have to applaud those involved to stick with the artistic choice to make this film.

3.0,"Arrival is a misleading movie. The film will make you think one thing and then another, all while having a great cast and a weak story. Arrival is probably one of my least favorite movies of 2016, which I haven't watched until now. Here is my non-spoiler review of Arrival.

9/10 points go to the ACTING category. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker, and friends give great performances. Adams makes a convincing character who's name I have already forgotten. Renner plays Ian, who is the only reason there is one point off from this category. He literally gives a stupid and idiotic delivery for his last line of the film. I won't say it, as it is a spoiler to the end.

4/15 points goes to the WRITING category. The story is basic. Weird aliens come to Earth, people want to know what they are, and Amy Adams is seeing stuff she can't explain. The first 30 minutes of the film and any sequence with the aliens is amazing. The rest is pretty bad. History is determined, but Adams doesn't know what to do/say. Adams is seeing stuff, but doesn't even care about what it is. There are even parts where it seems like present and unknown tense are coming together. The story is not written to well.

10/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The aliens look real, and so do the shells. No problems here like about everything else.

4/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are basic. We get little development from them. There is a tiny bit of development for Adams and Ian, but I won't tell you because it is a spoiler. Many people can only be called ""people who scream and complain a lot"", which is pretty basic.

2/5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. There is a bit of a conflict and a bit of a compromise. There is a bit of an answer to a question that doesn't get answered. There are a lot of plot holes. This movie also, as I previously said, has a bit of character development which is a spoiler.

2/5 points go to the ORIGINAL MUSIC SCORE category. The score is basic, it is very noticeable most of the time, and that is a bad thing. I didn't find the score at all or even a bit interesting. 

3/5 points go to the DESIGN category. The design in a bit cool I guess. It is a bit original and is a bit lame at the same time. It is pretty dark sometimes, and I don't like that. I like the movie's way of showing that things are a bit rushed within the way that things are unorganized. I don't know if that was or wasn't untended by the director.

10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. Everything that seems planned is done well. Most of the delivery is pretty good. Yeah. That's about all I have to say about the direction of this movie. Nothing stands out.

4/10 points go to the VISION AND SOUND QUALITY category. You can barely hear the actors for most of the movie. The movie is very dark for many scenes which is pretty bad. Some of the scenes do look good. The editing is also pretty bad for most of the film's random vision scenes that Adams is having.

7/20 points go to the MY OVERALL CONSENSUS category. The film is boring, seems unorganized, and overall, I thought it was pretty bad.

4.5,"The aliens are back and this time there is no Jeff Goldblum on a yellow school bus!
I hereby officially announce the beginning of the Oscar race, let the fight begin! It took a while this year! Gosh, as soon as this movie arrives it begs to be praised and saying what makes it good is as easy as understanding quantum physics. First of all, you have to understand that, more than anything, this is a character study. No, it's not a movie about aliens, an invasion, or even a conflict between beings from outer space and humans. It's primarily about a character and her inner conflict and psyche. We're start to finish with Louise to learn of what she makes of what's happening around her and how that is changing her. This is done beautifully in Sicario and in that sense it seems pretty similar the way we follow Kate (from Sicario) and Louise, making sure that we're constantly enthralled in order to understand them. This is done by shifting a little bit of the attention from what surrounds Louise to her expression and by having a performance to match it. No surprise there, but Amy Adams just blows it out of the park giving a subtle and realistic performance that is absolutely translucent to the character's inner state. Many haven't noticed, but Amy is the new Leo, having 5 nominations and no win but this season, whether with this one or Nocturnal Animals, I believe she has a good shot of getting that gold! Furthermore, this film not only has a fantastically substantiated script and plot, but also has the technical side to support it: the cinematography is rich and very identifiable, the sound design is well thought out and the aliens and ship's design is marvellous. The music is also close to perfection as Jóhannsson accentuates and gives even more meaning to important moments, and keeps quiet when he should. I also like that this movie takes such a fresh approach to the genre, as it manages to make a film about a translator actually damn gripping! I'm a fan of this trend of intellectual astute sci-fi movies that is being developed recently. And like Interstellar, this one comes with an even better grounded and believable twist.  The end gives meaning to the film, making it more than just about some aliens, but about communication, loss and the way we conceive time.

Kommunikation als wichtigstes Instrument der Welt. Gerade in der Zeit des Internets ist es möglich mit jedem Menschen auf der Welt zu kommunizieren, da ist es verständlich, dass es auch Missverständnisse gibt. Dass diese aufgrund von Übersetzern gelöst werden können ist offensichtlich. Aber wie geht man mit Lebewesen um, die eine komplett unerforschte Sprache sprechen? Dieses Thema setzt Arrival brillant um. Er konzentriert sich komplett auf die ersten Interaktionen zwischen der Menschheit und den Aliens, ohne dabei in eine CGI-Schlacht auszuarten, Dabei ist er keineswegs langweilig. Es steh immer eine Spannung im Raum und man möchte die ganze Zeit wissen, warum die Aliens auf der Erde sind und was sie den Menschen mitteilen wollen. Amy Adams kauf man die Rolle der Linguistin und Jeremy Renner die Rolle des Physikers auf jeden Fall ab.Der Film bietet großartige Bilder und einen überwältigenden Sound.

4.5,"Reviewed 2.24.18. It's marriage of an intriguing overarching theme and a deeply personal story line resonates long after the curtain drops. 

This is not an action film, instead its graceful construction generates thrills for the mind. The motion is all internal, and that's what makes it special.  

The best alien movies have nothing to do with the visitors, except for the mirror they hold up to us. Arrival excels in that blinding reflection. 

No silly alien battles or cliched scares, just a masterfully crafted script and deft directing. Along with top-notch performances, led by the ever reliable Amy Adams, it's a modern classic for the emotionally literate class.

The acting was very convincing but I did not care for the constant scenic darkness and one of my pet peeves, continual whispered dialogue. They went a bit over the top creating a foreboding, depressive mood. The overall production seemed low budget, perhaps the need for dark, blurry scenes and much of the dramatic action in a tent.

5.0,"At its core Arrival is not an alien movie but, as the featured image suggests, a human movie. It's a movie about the power of humanity and our need to overcome divisive rhetoric and fear in order to survive. It's especially poignant in the current U.S. political climate, when it's not difficult to imagine a historically significant event bringing us to the edge of catastrophe.

It's hard to find fault in any aspect of this movie, so instead, I'll stick to what works well. Amy Adams' initially flat performance is incredibly nuanced - don't disregard her as a contender for Best Actress. The sound mixing and score are beautifully handled, creating a space for the movie to breath and feel and exist without shoving emotions down the audience's throat. The cinematography is stunning, aided by beautiful scenery and near-flawless visual effects.

Finally, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (previously wasted on projects like The Thing and Final Destination 5) handles the source material from the sci-fi short story ""Story of Your Life"" with aplomb. I'm seeking out an original copy of the story now, to see how much he adapted, and how much was just not screwing it up (a real danger in Hollywood these days, no matter the quality of the source).

I'm on the edge of my seat eager for the Academy Award nominations (three days!) to see how many Arrival pulls in. Simultaneously, it won't surprise me if this low-budget, indie film is too nuanced to get the recognition it deserves. Never fear - I may not be the Academy or Roger Ebert, but this movie has my full endorsement.

At the end I was worried that the plot was going full Interstellar, but they actually pulled it off and made it mostly make sense. If the end of Interstellar made 40%-50% sense, Arrival made 95% sense. Amy Adams gives a great performance as usual.

If I have one nitpick, it's that the movie takes a while to get going. They do a masterful job of building the tension before we see the ships and then before we see the aliens, but I would have preferred it had been a bit faster.

4.5,"The Arrival of a Lifetime

In Denis Villeneuve's movie, Arrival, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the United States' last hope to prevent a catastrophic world war. Upon the arrival of 12 massive, foreign ships, the world becomes plagued with chaos and fear. Throughout this sci-fi, Inception-esc film, the unexpectant viewer is taken on a high-intensity, unpredictable, and yet, perfectly engineered rollercoaster of excitement and suspense. 

However, one cannot review this movie without mentioning the inspiration behind it: ""The Story of Your Life"". This is a short story novella written by Ted Chiang that is centered around language. Chiang's inspiration for this novella was the philosophical theory of free will. To incite further thoughts, Chiang poses the question, ""If you know what's going to happen, can you keep it from happening?""   This century old ethical question is addressed in Chiang's novella. 


This exciting production takes place in the barren plains of Montana, where professor of linguistics Louise Banks and her team are tasked with an urgent, classified assignment. She is asked to put to test her extensive knowledge and skills of language and translation in just a short period of time; that is, before other countries lose faith in each other and begin pointing their fingers. While diligently working to complete such an extensive task, professor Banks is afflicted by an unknown, futuristic paradigm of what language will entail one day. However, it becomes apparent that the extraterrestrials haven't come for any reason other than to save themselves. 

This review, while not full of complete story lines and time frames, is in simple words, a spoiler. 

The method the extraterrestrials use to save themselves is unexpected by most viewers. This large-scale theme is perfectly illustrated in a single scene. The scene commences with an unauthorized military man entering the alien ship and placing C4 within the chamber of communication. Without this knowledge, Dr. Banks and her associate, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), rush to the pod in attempt to decipher the alien language. As the C4 explosive is about to detonate, the alien sacrifices itself to preserve the life of Dr. Banks and Ian Donnelly. Ironically, however, Dr. Banks is the only person capable of deciphering, understanding, and later, teaching this completely foreign language. Even more so, it is precisely this language that will save the alien species from utter extinction by allowing those who know such language to see the future.  

With this ability to see into the future, the viewer finally comes to an understanding of the continuous, what-seem-to-be flashbacks troubling Dr. Banks. Indeed, such visions are not flashbacks by any sense of word; they are, in fact, the polar opposite: flash-forwards. Throughout the entirety of the movie, Dr. Banks develops a continuously growing knowledge of the alien language and, for that reason begins to see into the future, which contains glimpses of her current unborn daughter. 

These reoccurring visions illustrate a deep sense of humility and maturity in Louise Banks. Knowing that her daughter is going to be born with a terminal illness, she happily accepts fate and looks forward to cherishing every moment with her future daughter. Beyond that, if this language allows for future knowledge, the extraterrestrials' knowledge is no confined to time. Simply put, they know their future. They know that C4 is going to explode and injure them. However, just like Louise Banks, they knowingly accept this fate. 

With a language like this, what is the limit? When knowledge isn't limited to the bounds of time who's to say what can and cannot be accomplished? On the other side, are humans mature and moral enough to accept this almost all-empowering language? This also alludes to Ted Chiang's novella and the inspiration behind it. Exists free will? If so, can one prevent the known future? All of these are questions that rise from this movie. 

Because of these ""flash-forwards"", Arrival takes on this Inception-like plot twist at the end. It is truly intriguing. Inception was a dream within a dream, induced by a particular party of interest, and used to influence a man's decision for the party's own benefit. Likewise, Arrival is a flash-forward, revealed by the extraterrestrials to Dr. Banks for their own interest. The reason the aliens show her these ""flash-forwards"" is to merely convince her to learn their language and therefore, be the architect of their future salvation. 

Regardless of comparisons, this was a perfectly executed film. How often does one witness a professor of linguistics as a ""save-the-day"", hero type character in a movie? On top of that, the portrayal of genuine, pleasant aliens is a scarce sight in today's world. Although their actions reflected self-indulged motives, the extraterrestrials came to give humanity a tool: their language. 

While completely enthralled by this film, certain questions came to mind. What happens to humanity over the next 3000 years, prior to the saving of these aliens? How does their language affect modern society and technology? What was so strong as to threaten the existence of these advanced extraterrestrials 3000 years from the time of the film? Of course, being a science fiction enthusiast, the idea of a sequel, prequel, or anything in-between this movie's timeline is captivating.     

All in all, this brilliant depiction of extraterrestrials and linguistics merged together forms what is now one of the most authentic, captivating films within the science fiction genre. In a single word, brilliant. This movie was nothing short of brilliance. The original integration of a linguist savior for an alien species is captivating, exciting, and refreshing.",Jacob G,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 12, 2017",Jacob G,/user/id/976766981,RT,976766981,

Arrival of this movie review. 

	What if you could perceive time all at once? What if you could know the past, present, and future? ""If you could see your life from start to finish, would you change things?"" said Dr. Louise Banks, main character played by Amy Adams in the movie ""Arrival"" 
The movie is extremely well put together and makes one think deeply about what is going on in movie as well as that their life means to them. Dr. Banks made the discovery that the language of those arrived does not represent sound or speech like the languages we know today but rather meaning and complete thoughts. She said ""When you learn it you begin to perceive time as they do. 
""I used to think this (speaking of birth) was the beginning of your story. Memory is a strange thing, It doesn't work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time, by its order. I remember moments in the middle. And this was the end. But now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived."" 
The movie has an extremely deep message. As Louise learns the language of the heptapods, she, like them, begins to perceive time as all at once, knowing past, present and future. She uses this ability to provoke our finite minds into contemplating the idea of seeing our lives from start to finish and if we would change things. It is implied that many of us would indeed change some aspect of our lives if we were to know the big picture, thus, teaching us to be wise in our decisions and relationships to not have any regrets.

4.0,"The name Denis Villeneuve is quickly becoming synonymous with great films. The man who directed Sicario, Prisoners, and Blade Runner 2049, brought us this smart tale of humans attempting to communicate with aliens. The premise sees a linguist (Amy Adams) and physicist (Jeremy Renner) work together with the government in an attempt to communicate with the invaders from another world. I appreciated that the story focused on that aspect instead of some fight with the other beings. The fact that we never know what the aliens or military members with Adams and Renner would do, made for some great tense scenes. There's a particular one with a ticking bomb that stood out as excellent. Adams shines above everything else with one of the best performances of her career. She portrays her desperation to understand these creatures, in the midst of some haunting visions, expertly. She and Renner played off each other well. There are some pacing issues, as things moved at a crawl in a few of the scenes towards the middle, but it picks up with a great ending.

4.0,"Smart and visually arresting science fiction tale about earth's first contact with aliens. Mysterious floating monoliths appear around the world and linguist Amy Adams, with help of physicist Jeremy Renner, work with the government to try and communicate with the aliens amid global fears and international political tensions. This story is more ""Close Encounters"" and ""Contact"" than ""Independence Day"" or ""War of the Worlds,"" where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it.

4.5,"This movie was amazing. It was absolutely beautiful and so unlike the dystopian alien massacre movies that dominate this category. It was refreshing and captivating- near perfect. I would highly suggest watching this movie if you want to feel both inspired and challenged. It's not as predictable as a lot of other mainstream movies; they give you just enough plot points and knowledge to follow a thread but not enough to draw all-telling solid conclusions (most of the time). The only major thing I had an issue with was:
**Warning: major spoiler ahead!**
The fact that Ian left Louise over something so petty!
I say 'petty' rightfully because this is an advanced scientist who has openly communicated with aliens, defied gravity, and knows that Louise can see the future (because obviously you don't just shield someone from a bullet while you listen to them speak Mandarin and save the world without questioning their actions later). 
He is this accepting of everything around him but yet he simply can't accept that his daughter will die early of cancer? We all die in the end- does that make life pointless or does it free us to enjoy what we have? If our lives were already written out would that make our actions hollow or valuable experiences we should really give ourselves into?
It really surprised me that a man of his understanding, acceptance, and intelligence left Louise over the pain of knowing his daughter will die early of cancer- and that Louise chose to have her anyways.
Most parents wouldn't trade anything in the world for even a minute of their child's life- would he have rather not had her at all than get to enjoy her beautiful life and fill his heart with love for her? 
I mean I get his divorce from her is used as a plot device to 1. Keep the pieces of the story from coming together too quickly, and 2. To demonstrate to the audience that things like the probability/knowing of death and heart break shouldn't keep us from following our hearts. 
BUT STILL. It pisses me off. I hate that such a seemingly deep character made such a shallow choice. Hannah always has been, and always will be theirs. Nothing in the world could've ever changed that- dead or alive, she always belonged to them. Before she had even existed she was theirs. 
e.g.
I wouldn't say I made the wrong choice picking my dog out as a puppy if I knew he was going to die of a degenerative disease 13 years later. I love him more than I can handle, and he will always hold a piece of my heart. Forever. No dog I would've picked out would live for eternity- and would I sacrifice the love I have for him specifically and the life he's lead for the sake of avoiding heartbreak? Never.

1.5,"You should not watch Arrival, because everything you need to know about the movie is right on the cover: Amy Adams staring solemnly into the distance, while Jeremy Renner gazes longingly. Oh yeah there's aliens that apparently deserve better placement than the black guy from Battleship Earth (arguably a better alien in that movie than the Cthulhu Heptapod things were in this one.)  

What makes this movie terrible, and not just able to be avoided unless you need some background noise for Netflix and Chill, is that your primal lizard brain really wants to like it.  The visuals are on fleek, and the score is one of those maudlin pastoral dirges that make you want to go to bed and die.  Speaking of dying, Amy Adams' kid dies.  That's not a spoiler because that's literally how the movie opens.  Just throws it right out there on the Thanksgiving dinner table.    It's gonna be a real depressing 2 hours, and don't you regret not clicking on the Avengers instead because, of course, now SHE wants to see what happens since dying children are like glue traps for millennial chicks and you're too invested at this point.

As for the rest of the synopsis, there are these aliens that come to earth in twelve of those old native american grind stones that you had to smash corn with when your 6th grade class visited that pioneer village, and they speak only in coffee stains.  Swear to God you're going to watch it not believing me and then go, ""Oh damn, he wasn't kidding like when he said Eleven dies in Stranger Things 2.""  Evidently these coffee stains allow you to see the future ONLY IF YOU ARE AMY ADAMS despite the fact that Jeremy Renner did just as much work and actually cracked the fact that the only way to save the world was to embrace this clumsy allegory for Globalism.  Where's your pay gap now, ladies?

So Amy and Jeremy try to stop Forrest Whitaker from blowing up the grindstone squids despite the fact that one of the Heptapods says something in Caffeinese translates to ""Use Weapon"" and that's usually the time the aliens should have actually stepped back and thought, ""Oh hell, that was probably a really stupid thing to choose as our first words to a militarily developed native race in whose yard we happen to be parked illegally.""  She eventually steals a phone and tells THE ONLY MILITARY GENERAL IN CHINA EVIDENTLY what his wife said right before she died and as they say in China, ""If you can remember what my wife told me on her death bed, then I have to call off my alien war.""  So he tells future Amy Adams his personal phone number knowing that present day Amy Adams would then know it because when red headed white girls bust out fluent Mandarin, you suddenly learn everything about FTL Time Travel (which this claimed to be but absolutely wasn't).

Oh yeah, also also Amy Adams keeps going back and forth in time every time she reads what the aliens are saying like she's having photosensitive time-seizures.  It's not confusing however, just remember that every time you see her with her kid, that part of the movie is completely vestigial to the main story and cutting it out would actually make everyone feel better.

So the aliens take Amy Adams up into their ship, and basically lay out the whole plot of the movie in subtitles because the director of this movie spent way too much time reminding everyone who watches this movie that humans are flawed, and are capable of getting sick and dying at a young age.  Oh yeah, and she goes from knowing about 4 words in Coffee stain/Caffeinese/whatever to being able to carry on entire existential discussions with aliens capable of INTERPLANAR TRAVEL yet know dick about grammar and conjugation, and talk like they came from super advanced albeit somehow still REALLY into Frank Lloyd Wright squid world on a J1 Study Visa.  Whole thing is just silly.

Oh yeah, and instead of deciding not to have a child so as to prevent it from suffering a horrible death, and just explain it to Jeremy Renner who will believe her because she just made the aliens go away and those people probably would know stuff like that,  she voice-overs this whole thing about embracing the inevitable because as soon as Jeremy Renner admits that he loves her he also leans in and Whispers Joe Biden-style, ""I want to put a baby in you"", or ""let's make a baby,"" or something super appropriate for a pre-first date phase of courtship.  

And then it literally ends.  And you're trying to conceal the genuine fury that Hollywood had the nerve to put a SCI-FI label on a Nicholas Sparks story.  What did the aliens eat?  What forms of government did they have on squid world?  Why did they talk in coffee circles?  what was the magic intelligent ink that they used to talk made of?  can you send me the PDF on how to learn that language so I can (trigger warning) Trump my friends who brag about knowing Tolkien Elvish.  These are the questions that should at least be teased with the hint of an answer if you're going to qualify as a legit science fiction film.

5.0,"On the strength of the director Denis Villeneuve's repertoire, more specifically his previous outing Sicario (my favourite film of 2015 hands down!) and with a age old movie premise and a stellar cast ,this academy award nominated movie is one that had intrigued me before viewing and left in awe long after. This director is undoubtedly on top of his game (Blade Runner 2049 promises great things in his hands!) and this movie is another shining example of the impressive catalogue being constructed by this maverick movie maker!
The film itself deals with twelve mysterious spacecraft's arrivals across the globe. A cross section skilled team--lead by expert linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are brought together to investigate the reason behind their visit. As the world teeters on the brink of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers. 
What transpires is a Spielberg/Nolanesque two hour emotive, powerful and visually stunning piece that is lifted to extra heights due the extraordinary performance of Amy Adams (how she wasn't nominated for this is simply beyond me!) who brings both strength and vulnerability to her magnificent role!

3.5,"Arrival is a really neat idea for a film. A language professor must communicate with aliens that have arrived, and figure out why they're here. The film has some stellar acting, and a neat premise. The payoff, however...well, you'll see.

The process of the first two-thirds of the movie is really neat. The slow build-up of understanding the language is shown very well, with Adams giving a great performance. I also enjoy the interplay between her and Forest Whitaker, the career army man.

I take issue with Jeremy Renner's character. It is not made plain in the entire film why he is there. He's supposed to a scientist, and he is shown doing scientisty things, but they have no effect whatsoever on the plot. It might have been a good idea to pull back the focus to flesh out the mission a little more.

Once we get to the third act, the big sci-fi reveal happens. Here's the problem: you've already established a certain level of strangeness in the film, and this third act adds a whole new layer. It really pulls the rug out from under you. It might work for someone who was ready for that level of sci-fi, but I was not. It got really complex, really fast, and I felt whiplash while watching it.

1.5,"If our first contact with an alien race turns out to be as boring as this movie, then  I hope it doesn't happen.   Big disappointment considering the nominations,  which makes it one of the most overrated movies of 2016.   Their ships look stupid, the aliens themselves look stupider,  and there's generally a lack of awe  at this event.  Only Jeremy Renner shows any signs of life, everyone else is sleepwalking including Amy Adams  who is blander than Top 40 radio.   She's a highly skilled linguist recruited by the military to communicate with these aliens, but none of her studying makes any difference as her only breakthroughs occur through memory flashes interacting with her daughter.  Naturally the military gets trigger-happy solely in order to inject some form of tension which is utterly predictable.  There's a fairly nifty revelation at the very end, but it's relied upon far too heavily to have a Shyamalan effect and cannot salvage the dreary experience until then.

5.0,"Finally, a Hollywood sci-fi alien movie with a linguist as the hero!

I don't even remember the last time I give 5.0 out of 5.0 rating for a film on RottenTomatoes, but the film ""Arrival"" definitely deserves this perfect rating. Seeing this film is like discovering a holy grail for students and fans of linguistics alike. As a polyglot, I love being able to see a sci-fi depicting a linguist trying to figure out an alien's language and the consequences of being able to communicate in their language.

I profoundly appreciate the fact that Hollywood is able to explore the theme of alien visitation without having to rehash the heap of manure in form of ""Alien Attacks!!!"" or how an ""American Superhero saves the world from those alien overlords!!!"" that has oversaturated the monde of American films in recent decades.

Amy Adams' emotional performance as the linguist (and as the only character who matters in the film, really) also helps to bridge the aliens to humans...and bridge the aliens' language to the viewers of the film.

In a way, this cerebral theme of alien sci-fi is reminiscent of Interstellar (except for the fact that the ""alien"" in Interstellar is of a completely different entity...I don't want to reveal spoilers here), in a way that the opening of the film provides major clues to the key of the plot.

When we see a time we don't know why we arrive to that never happened of us communicating with a life that we don't even remember. When we see that other things arrive to this world we never have seen before that sends the world into a communication frenzy of its intention. When somethings we have never seen before we don't know how to communicate with when their arrival is unknown to us. When other things arrive at our door step when they need our communication expertise to decipher what others dont understand. When we see the world is prepared for such arrivals if they ever took place and communicate separately their plan of execution if such events were to happen. When we see that we arrived at our destination where we are prepared to communicate with the life forms. When how we arrive at our translation only we know when we followed closely the communications and languages of all life's communications that ever existed to know who we are dealing with. When we see that our arrival to see such species we find hard to communicate with, when a communication is new and needs further investigating to arrive at a new language. When we do see that we have to start somewhere when some language deciphering enabled us to uncover other languages by starting at ourselves in the way we communicate and arrive to a meaning or purpose. When we see we give humanism to species to communicate eye to eye we ought to see them in order to arrive at the connection between human & alien. When we see that we need to introduce species to how we communicate by arriving the fact that we are identifying them, questioning them, specifying them and uncovering more details we need to know about their language. When we see that communication is different everywhere that we must arrive to different views in what is methodology is used. When we see that we arriving to a species means of communication would take years when we have yet to understand the species to fully grasp the language that we see time is not on our side when others communicate differently then we do an interpret messages and communications differently that arrive to either an opposing or agreement that we have yet to solve. When we arrive at the thought that what pushes us to great lengths of friction is we are different and communicate differently that our final arrival to our decision lies squarely on obsession for perfection & accuracy over fears. When we see communication is difficult when others arrive to the fears of the worse and rather end talks be left alone to defend ourself. When we don't see all of what life has to offer from our past to future we don't know much truths to include such communications in our dialogue to  arrive at a different relationship. When what we can't see others see in our flaws that they understand about us but can't communicate with us their knowledge when it's to vast to be studied upon that we arrive with a gift in their intentions. When we see that time between us lasted much too long when we have yet to understand our own flaws that prevent us from communicating well and arriving to progress as fast as others that some solutions in understanding us and getting around our own weapon of defense to arrive at a single person whom can deliver the message for us. When we can now see a time so distant that it hasn't happened yet, we arrive to the clues given from our future that is helpful to our present to save us from ourselves that changes the way we receive communicate. When we see that moments stitched in time have a palindrome (Hannah), linking present and future simultaneously that arrives us to instant communication & knowledge. When we see what we couldn't see before we arrive at how advanced some species are that we can't reach a level of communication they have reached to only receive a gift to advance our communication when ours remain to hold us back. When we see trust and good will is hard to gain when we all arrive at the thought of being number 1 that communication is hard to achieve. When we see the purpose of their arrival is to communicate with us help not now but in the future to which time is nonlinear to the present and how we advance now till then we know we need to when we have advanced allies relying on us to succeed. When we don't always see such things that arrive to us as they might be intended we see signs as humans communicate it to mean but don't understand signs could be another thing when we communicate and categorize all truths we fail to diversify everything in other forms to clearly see what has arrived to us. When we see how unadvanced humans are we see that even though we know the future we always arrive at the first thought of greed & thinking about ourself when we communicate not for the collective goal but the sole goal alone, that we alienate everyone and everything to do the same (death of hannah).

4.5,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it looks like we ve finally arrived 

SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) ... and its about time. Literally. Let s get to reviewing this next movie about alien visitation.

GREG: We re introduced to Professor Leslie Banks (Amy Adams) who is having a strange day as 12  shells  (very large egg-shaped alien craft) have landed across the world. She s visited by a Colonel Webber (Forest Whitaker) who insists she help him translate the speech patterns of the aliens. She resists but ultimately gives in when her curiosity gets the better of her. She s whisked away to a midwest town where she is paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and must discover the reason for the alien visit.

SCOTT: Banks and Donnelly meet two of the aliens and nickname them Abbott and Costello. Communication seems impossible until Banks attempts written language. She discovers that the aliens  writing is composed of complex circular characters and sentences, and she also discovers that the more she deciphers the language, the more strange visions she has of herself raising a child. Meanwhile, in China, General Shang (Tzi Ma) is about to wage war with the aliens, making it imperative that Banks and Donnelly crack the code before disaster strikes.

GREG: Arrival is a film that arrived without much fanfare. I don t recall seeing any previews for it in the theaters or ads on TV. So, I had very few preconceptions going in. And I was pleasantly surprised. This is an arguably ponderous film with very little action and a lot of dialog. It s a thinking-man s movie, so it appealed to me. One of the opening scenes has physicist Donnelly reading Banks  book which states that all interactions begin with language. But he differs - claiming the basis for communication is science. Whereas Colonel Webber is looking at the situation from a tactical point of view. And so the stage is set for a three-way confrontation of ideals. And in the end, it is Banks  view that wins out. I was favorably impressed.

SCOTT: Greg, I loved Arrival. It s been a long time since we ve encountered a meaty science fiction story that really makes you think. I was struck by the possibility that our language is not so much a reflection of our linear thinking but a determinant of it. The temporal non-linearity of the aliens was fascinating and allowed for some truly creative plot developments. We re also treated to some wonderfully innovative renditions of aliens and alien language. Not to mention that Amy Adams delivers a terrific performance as a hero who must piece together the temporal puzzle to save the world. It all adds up to a stellar movie, pardon the pun.

GREG: Amy Adams was definitely the brightest star in this film. Her character Leslie Banks undergoes a strong transformation from disillusioned academic to an enlightened world figure. She also exhibits uncommon empathy for the aliens. She puts aside her innate fear of the unknown and is captivated by the question of what is the purpose of the alien visit. I found her very inspiring.

SCOTT: Banks definitely goes on an inspired hero s journey -- yet another example of Hollywood finally  getting it  that women characters can make tremendous heroes in the movies. The hero s journey begins with Banks answering the  call  from the military to make first contact with aliens who have landed in Montana. She immediately assumes a lead role in her partnership with Donnelly, a physicist on her team. Her missing quality is her understanding of the alien language, and the keys to her acquiring this quality are her openness to thinking outside the box, her trust that the aliens will do no harm, and her courage to defy the military s antagonistic approach to the alien encounter. Banks possesses many of the great eight characteristics of heroes; she is smart, strong, resilient, reliable, caring, inspiring, and selfless. In keeping with the hero s journey, she encounters a love interest (Donnelly), allies in Abbott, Costello, and oppositional forces in the military and CIA. Her mentors turn out to be the aliens themselves, who have arrived to help the earth understand and change their language and use of time. In exchange, the earth will help the aliens 3,000 years from now. Everything comes full circle, which is beautifully symbolized in the alien circular linguistic characters.

GREG: The aliens are good mentor figures here. And we also see that Banks acts as a hero-mentor in that she mentors the aliens in our language. After all, it is she who instructs the aliens, not the other way around. However, this does imply a bit of a plot hole. If the aliens are so advanced, why are they so dense in understanding our language? Compare to our own understanding of animal language. It is human researchers who have taught apes to speak American Sign Language. I would think it incumbent upon the more advanced civilization to find a way to communicate with us. Arrival is a departure from other first contact movies like Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind where language is the source of the communication. I enjoyed the slow burn from fear to understanding for all the characters in the story. I give Arrival 4 out of 5 Reels. Dr. Banks is a great hero who undergoes a transformation from naive to educated in the ways of the alien creatures. Like many heroes we ve studied in the last few years, she has a  super power  which in this case is the ability to understand language. But it is her human innate quality of empathy which endears Banks to us. I give her 4 out of 5 Hero points. And Banks is the most excellent hero-mentor. And when you join her with the superior alien-mentors we get a mentoring experience that goes beyond what most films offer. I give Banks and the aliens 4 out of 5 Mentor points. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:

SCOTT: Arrival is the science fiction you ve been looking for in film for several years now. Greg, the plot hole you identify is not so much a hole but the key to understanding the puzzle with which the aliens present humanity. Twelve shells arrive on earth, each with a different piece to the puzzle that the twelve earth stations must share to unravel the mystery. The idea is to bring humanity together in a non-zero-sum-game-like way. This guiding principle, along with stunningly crafted heptapods and their innovative language, make Arrival a treat to watch. I give this film the full 5 Reels out of 5. Louise Banks proves herself braver and smarter than all her male counterparts in both developing a working relationship with the aliens and in deciphering their cryptic language. She encounters friends who help her and foes who oppose her, and she undergoes a profound mental transformation. In our latest book Reel Heroes & Villains, we define a mental transformation as a significant change in the way that a hero views the workings of the universe. Banks now sees time, language, and thought as intertwined. She travels the full hero s journey, including the act of giving back to society what she has learned in the form of lectures and a book on the universal language of the heptapods. She earns the full 5 Heroes out of 5. The mentorship is also strong in this film, with the aliens mentoring Banks as well as the entire human race itself. Our planet is taught how essential it is for our survival to adopt a non-zero-sum philosophy in our international relations. You re right, Greg, that Banks also mentors the aliens -- although I suspect they intentionally adopted a passive stance in the first contact proceedings to force us to do the work of deciphering and cooperating with each other internationally.

The effects, sometimes breathtaking, not only fit the style of the film well, but also add so much to the overall quality of the movie because of the sheer realism and impressiveness of the CGI was nothing to scoff at. I give it a 9/10 because despite all of its obvious and sweeping victories, I felt some scenes between action points and developing character back story arcs were pretty slow, and it cut up the flow of the movie at the start.

The film is about the arrival of alien life on Earth and humanity's reaction to this which varies from attempts to communicate and understand to declarations of war.  Anyone expecting an action packed alien invasion movie will be disappointed.  This story is played out with a lot more intelligence and respect for it's audience and it has the greatest emotional gut punch I've ever experienced in an alien movie.

Por supuesto esto no podría quedar bien si la mano ejecutora (Villeneuve en este particular caso) no estuvisese a la altura de las circunstancias. La dirección es magnífica y eso se refleja en el gran trabajo de Amy Adams y Jeremy Renner, aunque los secundarios no están lejos de tampoco.

Por supuesto, la fotografía y edición, completan el trabajo con sobresaliente, apoyando al apartado de los efectos visuales.

2.5,"You want to watch this film because the story is about contact and communication with an extraterrestrial life form, right?  Well, for some obnoxious reason you will be sent off with a corny Lifetime family drama and an unexplained magical ability instead.  Horrible corny, cringe worthy ending!  (Brenner's last line almost completely destroys this movie for me.)

Arrival does begin as an intriguing story about patience and communication, and Amy Adams does deliver a great performance as a cool headed but emotionally pressured professional. But this story is very regrettably swapped out for a cheesy, ""emotional"" family drama instead.

It's sad because the obvious initial ""contact"" premise of the story is truly fantastic and well performed. But to ultimately steer the film into a completely different direction towards a focus more on the main character's emotional family life left me feeling like the victim of a really bad bait and switch storytelling tactic. 

The soundtrack sounded corny and cringe worthy, as if it were constantly and consciously TRYING to illicit uneasiness or fear in the listener / viewer, yet being painfully obvious about it to the point of distraction at times.

I can't help feel there was potential for a great story arc, but it was squandered just to tell you an over-used family drama trope story you hadn't even paid to see.  

All in all, good performances, lovely visuals, important messages trying to be conveyed. Ultimately, this is a very good film which the writer, Eric Heisserer, unfortunately took nowhere in particular.

4.0,"A beautifully acted and cerebral piece of sci-fi that's almost as smart as it portends to be, Arrival nonetheless captivates with a thought-provoking puzzler that brings to mind Close Encounters of the Third Kind...had Terrence Malick directed it, that is. 

In this PG-13-rated sci-fi drama, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Contemplative is the word for this thinking man's alien invasion flick. Our eyes, ears and mind, Banks is a linguist emotionally scarred by a tragedy. She doesn't think linearly and neither does the film. Far from straight-forward, the film mindbends and timebends with achingly gorgeous photography that frames the locations as much as the characters. This is a key point. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Interstellar before it, Arrival wraps you up in an atmospheric spectacle while leaving a lightyear's worth of room for interpretation. The end result is both quantitative and qualitative, though director Denis Villenueve had some obvious influences. Terrence Malick never made a straight sci-fi flick but, if he did, it might look a lot like this. The beauty of nature being interrupted by an obstructive force and opaque flashbacks/flash forwards are two Malick touchstones that both feature prominently in Arrival. Villenueve's work has always been bleak and gripping but his latest definitely resembles Malick's The Tree of Life more than Prisoners or Sicario. Like those last two searing dramas, it still concentrates on troubled characters and maintains a funereal tone but the canvas is more expansive and less conclusive. For some audiences, it will make them say 'Huh?' For the filmgoers that say 'Hmm,' however, Arrival is a welcome departure from the cut and dry space franchises currently Trekking and Warring across screens. 

Regardless of where the coin falls, Amy Adams grounds the drama quotient for all viewers with a deeply emotional performance. Ever since her very deserving Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for Junebug in 2005, this artist has made bold affecting choices. That she would do this and the very different Nocturnal Animals within the same short window, both daring but singularly amazing turns, seems improbable if not downright impossible. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker turn in solid supporting performances without which she couldn't fully develop her character, but make no mistake about it: Second to Villeneuve, this is her show. And that goes for the aliens too.

With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world.

It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself.

5.0,"I struggled with picking this one as my favorite film of 2016 because ""Manchester By The Sea"" affected me on a more primal level... but you cannot ignore the near flawless execution of this film, from the original story to the fantastic acting to the meticulously crafted atmosphere and tone.  Every last beat is damn near perfect.  I have heard people criticize this movie for being slow and not making sense, but I was riveted throughout the entire thing, and I can't really argue about the making sense bit without spoiling the whole movie.  Suffice it to say that the story gradually reveals itself precisely and intentionally, and is impeccably done.  I'll admit it's a slow burn, but oooh, that burn is so good!  Director Denis Villeneuve is a master of building tension, and he gets better at it with every film.  The concept of this film is entirely original and complex, it's pretty heady stuff that really makes you think.   Though the movie is technically about aliens, it is not your traditional sci-fi film.  I would categorize it more as a suspense film with a dramatic core.

They are hoping for aliens, and some sort of communication. Louise is pretty darn smart and into language, so she get the job in a rush.

Very strong story - pretty realistic to be a sci-fi film. It's cold and quite bleak, never overdone but pretty and filled with subtle style. The lovestory thing is the smallest of sub plots and I like that a lot. By the way, I found the plot both smart and touching with some neat twists. The film has good pace but slower moments happen frequently - it's a good thing then, that the images, the camerahandling, the effects, the colors, the score - is all brilliant. You can't look away.

Villeneuve is an amazing director - this is as good as ""Prisoners"" and way better than ""Sicario"" if you ask me. The guy does not know how to fail, really. Good performances too, the actors need a mention - Amy Adams delivers her best role so far, surrounded by other strong names on the poster.

5.0,"This was unexpectedly pretty good. I mean, I didn't expect anything out of this sci-fi drama but it was actually pretty good. Amy Adams is the star of this film and she has done remarkably well in this movie. Along with Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, the movie's story somehow is progressively well. The first half of the movie would make you think it'll be just another typical sci-fi film but it's not. The connection between humans and the aliens reminded me the movie called The Abyss for some reason.

With the effort of Amy Adams' character by learning the language from the aliens and trying to understand them and especially the purpose, was quite touching. It even portrays how the rest of humanity deals with something they have never seen before. It shows like how China would go drastic measures without a real good reason but to retaliate. It's interesting how it shows humanity's reaction towards something unknown. Something out of this world. This movie gives a good example of humanity of interacting something alien, in global wide public.

Arrival has a touching story while attracting with the unknown that's out of this world. Giving us an example on how to deal with life itself and question about it at the same time.

3.0,"Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams), is lecturing at a Massachusetts university when twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear at twelve different locations across Earth. U.S. Army colonel G.T. Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks Louise to join physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and find out why they have come. She is brought to an army camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call ""heptapods""; Ian nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, written in a substance analogous to ink, or dark smoke, and she begins to learn a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to have visions of herself with her daughter and of their relationship with the absent father. When Louise finally asks why the aliens have come to Earth, they answer ""offer weapon"". An alternate translation of ""use weapon"" is made at another site. This leads China to break off communications with the rest of the world; other nations also stop exchanging information. However, Louise argues that the symbol interpreted as ""weapon"" might mean ""tool"". Louise is hoping to unravel what the ""heptapods"" means which could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind...

Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""Arrival delivers a must-see experience for fans of thinking person's sci-fi that anchors its heady themes with genuinely affecting emotion and a terrific performance from Amy Adams."" Brian Tallerico, from RogerEbert.com, gave the film three out of four: ""It's a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds."" At Time.com, Sam Lansky described it as ""sophisticated, grownup sci-fi: a movie about aliens for people who don't like movies about aliens."" IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying: ""Arrival is a language lesson masquerading as a blockbuster, though much more entertaining than that sounds. The film features shades of Interstellar, Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but never feels derivative. Rather it's smart, sophisticated sci-fi that asks BIG questions, and does a pretty good job of answering them."" British film critic Robbie Collin gave Arrival five out of five, calling it: ""introspective, philosophical and existentially inclined - yet it unfolds in an unwavering tenor of chest-tightening excitement. And there is a mid-film revelation - less a sudden twist than sleek unwinding of everything you think you know - that feels, when it hits you, like your seat is tipping back."" The UK newspaper The Guardian rated it as the third best film of 2016.[53] Critic Catherine Shoard said that it ""amounts to something transcendent; something to reignite your excitement for cinema, for life."" Numerous other publications, including io9, Den of Geek, WhatCulture, Mir Fantastiki, The Atlantic, Blastr, and Digital Trends named Arrival the best movie of 2016.

Director Denis Villeneuve has excited me three times in a row with ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"" and ""Sicario. Magnificent films in my point of view. Of course I was keen on seeing ""Arrival"" as I couldn´t see how Villeneuve could fail with this genre. ""Arrival"" is somewhat a mix of ""Interstellar"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" as mentioned and the philosophical and existential approach is intriguing (and the classic ""Are we alone?"" question will always be a current topic) and the film has great CGI, strong performances and an interesting use of sounds by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. However, the storyline doesn´t really grasp you, the tension is not really there, you get lost in the ""smart"" dialogue and the pace is just too slow if you ask me. Instead of feeling there were plenty to reflect over after the film ended, I felt more like a question mark over the slightly pretentious piece of film I had just witnessed. The same feeling I had after seeing ""Interstellar"". Yes, the main subjects (time, love, loss, self-discovery and what it means to be human) are good ones and a unique entity of a film is there. But, the end result is not what I hoped for. 

Trivia: Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Villeneuve and their teams managed to create a ""logogram bible,"" which included over a hundred different completely operative logo-grams, seventy-one of which are actually featured in the movie.

While the shape of the ship was decided early on, Denis Villeneuve had great difficulty imagining an interior that would allow humans to easily navigate through such a steep and vertical design. The later decision to turn gravity sideways offered an obvious and convenient solution.

""Dirty Sci-fi"" is what director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Bradford Young called the look they created together for Arrival. Villeneuve wanted it to feel like ""This was happening on a bad Tuesday morning, like when you were a kid on the school bus on a rainy day and you'd dream while looking out the window at the clouds.""",Ola G,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Jun 30, 2017",Ola G,/user/id/790840760,RT,790840760,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/884090343/picture

3.0,"Two movies for the price of one. The first, a fine meditative sci-fi with Amy Adams as a gloomy linguistic genius called upon to communicate with a newly arrived alien species floating in 12 enormous concrete dill pickles around the globe. The story is at least mind-expanding if not mind-blowing. Adams slowly grasps that their language and their experience of time is non-linear (nicely displayed by having their sentences expressed as circles with weird little fractals spinning off in every direction) and then saves the world even as she deals with her own tragedies. Chick-flicky but very nice work.

The other movie has lines like ""Montana is in lockdown"", and ""China has called a press conference"", calling to mind those 1950s giant monster movies where the guy in the white lab coat is always saying ""get me the Army"" or some such. And it has predictable gun-nut reactionary military characters including a captain in charge of the most delicate mission in world history who might as well have ""paranoid psycho"" tattooed on his forehead.

4.5," I do not often go to the movie theater twice in the same month, let alone in back to back 

weeks.  The fact that I did says a lot about the buzz this movie has.  It is a movie that flew in 

under the radar a bit so I went into it not sure what to expect.  It begins in an unexpected

manner and opens with heartfelt tragedy, which cannot be an easy thing to do since no one

has invested in any of the characters.  The entire movie progresses in a fascinating manner with 

a unique, slow suspense that makes for a very bizarre movie going experience.  You continue 

along knowing that it is going somewhere but having no idea where, and it is done so in a well

contained manner that does not cause many peaks that are too high or valleys too low.  As you

progress further on this perfectly symmetrical, slow zig-zag pace you remain optimistic that

the movie is progressing towards tragedy undone.  Then it stops zig-zagging and blows up your 

mind with an ending that is so bittersweet that it leaves you dumbstruck.


     When rating the movies I see in theaters, I often start at 10 and go backwards.  It's not an 

exact science but if I get offended by something, I take off a point.  If I get confused by

something, I take off a point.  If something stands out as out of place, I take off a point.

Arrival did not have any faults that I could see, other than wanting more of an 

explanation as to why the aliens came and why they did what they did.  For me it never answered 'WHY ARE

THEY HERE!?!'  This is still a very good movie and another in a string of great sci-fi movies such as

Interstellar and The Martian, and I look forward to seeing it again.

4.5,"Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science Fiction

The vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a ""that never will happen"" or a ""this is impossible"". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: ""reality surpasses fiction"". Although modern events are or were influenced by constraint, opinion disparities, ambition or vileness, the other piece has invested us partially as equality organisms in terms of race and eliminator of misogyny. We've got over cataclysms, world wars or an everyday interpersonal uproar, we've interred pride and unified us as human beings in a universal manner; at present, we shouldn't look beyond the stars, we have to plan to get beyond them.

Sci-fi genre takes the Maremagnum of a discipline to the extreme in a context in which there may be a high, medium, or minimum probability nature, having the chance to provide certain bi-dimensional items to the work called fiction. It can either derail astray by slated and mostly deficient burial of science opportunities and overflowing imagination until the chimeric (""Star Wars"" & ""Star Trek""), or otherwise, it can avail itself a global thesis supported by foundations with scientific sustenances to a greater or lesser extent, relegating the creative freedom. Big exponents have sprung up in recent decades since Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg gave terror and erudition in the obligatory sci-fi classics of the past (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien""). Contemporary filmography has already designated an admissible leader who inextricably will bring out a genuine questioning about reality ability that goes beyond any perishable preset fringe; a director, screenwriter, producer and editor who usually employs in the most of his films the issue of higher research complexion, moreover, Nolan is the equivalent to the inextricable space-time relativity.

""Metaphysics conception as a problem that falls outside the limits of theoretical reason"" or ""The consideration of philosophy as a reflection about scientific knowledge"" are two of the thousands of proverbs that Prussian philosopher maintains his celebrated and accepted Kant's theory. Kant, a lead of criticism and undaunted thinker and forefather of German idealism, states any space-time expression is linked to man's conscious emphatically. The human being, by nature, infers a fixed time and space in which life undertakes its elapsing, in where existence is born and days germinates.

This one has been the central axis for dialectic in some films, this ontological question was manifested to a greater or lesser transgression on ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" or ""Looper"", it's worth to mention that inevitably the rule of future vis-à-vis present must be on screen. The latest movie in using this question as a sudden McGuffin into in crescendo drama is ""Arrival"" from hypnotic and disturbing director Denis Villeneuve. The filmmaker made use of brand-new insight of the relativity erected by Nolan in his eighth work, which's trustworthy of magnanimity and hegemony that he can get to have, giving rise to a modern perspective and turning it into a time materialism more based on communication than science itself, albeit, the intrepid director dares with this fabulous drama taking any thought that is scientifically correct as true, to apply the largest possible artistic and narrative elasticity to the captivating story.

As its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of ""A Space Odyssey""; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do ""they"" use some kind of informational exchange? How will ""they"" discern what they want to express? May do ""they"" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a ""why"" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?

After an introduction that argues much of the footage, space-time thesis conceived by Eric, Villeneuve and the crew feigns not having too much harmony and begins a non-correlative spiral of Louise's anachronistic memories with her daughter and her ""past"". The script and drama begin to set up a cohesion and a portentous verism through the jargon and space and time in which the story unfolds. Later, we'll be witness to a key moment where human speech and all its frivolous variables put to shame by colliding with two heptapods contained within a colossal capsule, who set aside rhetoric with flashbacks or flash-forwards, with odds or hints, with regular structure stipulating a clause as a sentence; subject, verb, and complement are obsolete facing communicative-visual epiphany that such beings treasure, a complicated dialectical system comprised a complete idea, captured in an unspeakable circular establishment, synthesized thus: ""depending on the language you speak, you see the world.""

""I don't believe in starts or finals"", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in ""Nocturnal Animals"", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.

Extravagant filmmaker's movie feels like a categorical victory. You know that a movie transcends when in each tiny component gravitate eternal beauty. From a film perspective, it ratifies the potential of its technical and acting team, moreover, claims Hollywood can deliver that quality entertainment we cry out, there are still stories that are worth it expose; the only thing they have to do is select suitable individuals for the suitable tales, we need an arrogant luck. From social and political perspective, it evinces unsteady assembly of our government systems and our attitude on the defensive to the unknown; the film tries to instruct spectators through the method of using head before hands, either in scientific, collective, personal or mother-to-child areas; we must deal with wisdom and good sense, not with nonsense and celerity.

With conviction and pride, I can declare that ""Arrival"" has the best sound editing and BSO in films for a long time; a sounding arrhythmia that is deafening when it requires it, tenacious at times of perplexity or victory and theatrical in the ineffable confession; musicality and cadence articulating with the photography which vouches for magnetic attenuation the picture; Bradford Young (""Selma"") decorates each frame with a gloomy atmosphere of uneasiness, of anonymity, of superiority in order to symbolize a clear helplessness. Not granting us the chance to see them until the moment in which Louise do so, triggers a vigorous connection between the actors and audience, what causes that in the climax are both who fall down in front of such artistic feat. A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that ""reading is work"", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.

An experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table.

4.0,"I love the fact that this is about first contact with an extra-terrestrial live form minus the repetitive Hollywood action frag fest when everything blows up as if it was Michael Bay-ized stashed together with a bunch of product placement (*cough* TF4 *cough*)

Instead, it concentrates more on a more grounded sci-fi concept of communications as two different civilizations are trying to understand each other. Some people may dislike it to the core for the lack of action. And yet, they don't realize that 'Arrival' focuses on the concept of time as a sort 'loop' rather than the normal linear perception (being the default order of Past-Present-Future) Furthermore, what was considered the highlight of the show was that the flow of the story is almost representational to the alien glyph, in such a way that 'the ending of the turns out to be its beginning', like a sentence arranged in
a circular pattern without a full stop.  

Given its strength, however, the movie is not without some of its weaknesses. >>> SPOILER ALERT <<< It still left me out a lot of questions which sometimes does not make any sense. For example:

_How does Louise knows about General Chang's wife's last dying words? Why did she called him in the first place? If she can convince him to stand down his force, how did she actually do it?
_Why did the aliens took only Louise up to their ship?
_What makes them depart earth altogether at the end?
_The question of 'What was your purpose here?' still being left unanswered. Almost feel like a cliffhanger. 

Other than its flaws, 'Arrival' is no doubt one of the best sci-fi out there in 2016. If you enjoy a good film that keeps your grey juices pumping, then this is one of those recommendations.

The story wasn't you typical alien invasion movie plot. It this one, there isn't any action or humans v aliens sub-genre. This one had a more serious tone to it.

3.5,"Denis Villeneuve's science fiction film never underestimates the audience's intelligence (using real scientists and linguistics scholars as advisors), yet it still comes across as somewhat loopy.  This may be because some of the logical connections that hold the plot together are given short shrift, ending up almost as MacGuffins (Hitchcock's term for the objects that drive the suspense plot, such as a secret formula that spies wish to obtain, that never really need to be understood or explained).  For example, we almost get to understand the links between learning the alien language and developing a mastery over time - but not quite.  Nevertheless, the film is enjoyable simply for the process that it unfolds, showing how human methods can be used to tackle a surreal situation (and to some degree how human nature can get in the way).  Amy Adams, linguist, and Jeremy Renner, scientist, are enlisted by Forest Whitaker, Colonel, to meet the aliens (who have landed their ships in 12 locations around the world) and to learn the purpose of their arrival (which means learning their language, a painstaking but enthralling task).  Interspersed with this are flashbacks from Amy Adams' life that help her to tackle the challenge.  The look of the film is sombre and the music often matches that mood.  Think of it as starting where Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1979) left off, with much of the action occurring inside the alien spacecraft.  What consequences would there be for humanity and for individuals?  There's more to think about - with a ""would you kill Hitler"" slant - but I hesitate to indulge in too many spoilers in this review; I'm not quite sure the final twist was done justice (though it does make you want to watch the film again).  Definitely worth a look, particularly if you like sci-fi.",Art S,False,False,False,False,3.5,"May 02, 2017",Art S,/user/id/792064900,RT,792064900,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/656648722/picture

5.0,"More than standard sci-fi fare.

It's most likely not what you think it is. If you like Sc-Fi, watch it. If you don't like Sci-Fi and are traditionally put off by it, watch it.

Non-specific spoilers ahead, but spoilers nonetheless. You've been warned.


We've probably all explored the overall theme at one time or another... if you could watch your life from start to finish.. would you change anything? More specifically... Would you give up your greatest joys to save yourself from your greatest pain? This is the question posed by Arrival. This isn't the first film to explore this theme, but it's done in such a unique way. Admittedly I cried for the last full five minutes of the film at least.

BIGGEST SPOILER BELOW:

When the reveal was made that the presumably flashback segments were actually flash forward segments.. revealing not the past but the future... whaaaat. The twist didn't feel contrived or too manipulated. And it tapped into the greater human emotion of love and loss, how we deal with the things we have no choice in, and how we would choose to deal with those monumental things if we were presented with the choice. Louise (Amy Adams) says yes. She chooses her life with her closing line of ""yes"". And we know the pain she is in for, she knows it, too. But we also know the tremendous amount of collective joy ahead of her. Because of that it is inspiring. Her life is not happening to her. She is walking into it full on saying yes. She is making the conscious choice. This is not typical sci-fi alien first encounter fare, and now I understand why it is enjoying eight Oscar nominations, (none for Amy Adams, though personally I think she was deserving). When you strip us all down, we each experience immense joy and immense pain as we journey through life. Sometimes it feels out of our control, and that's frustrating. It's a shared human condition. The prevalent theme here, bigger than monsters or aliens or our seeming willingness to destroy under the illusion of self preservation- in the end, how many of us would trade all of our most incredible joys in order to not have to feel the incredible sorrow? Probably not many. I hope not many.",Angel M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Apr 10, 2017",Angel M,/user/id/976254699,RT,976254699,

5.0,"Was anyone else worried that this film was going to be your typical alien invasion movie, where the safety of planet earth is in jeopardy for the 100th time? Well thankfully Denis Villeneuve had a different idea for the genre of alien science fiction invasion movies. Arrival takes the idea of extraterrestrial life invading earth and puts a very realistic spin on it. This film explores how humans would try and communicate with aliens that do not speak our language. I want to start by saying that everyone in this movie does a terrific job acting especially Amy Adams. However the star of the film might actually be Denis Villeneuve. This guy knows how to direct movies, and after Arrival he has now solidified himself as one of the best directors working today. The cinematography in this film is mind blowing, every shot in this movie looks amazing. Not only does he direct this film to perfection, but he showcases a very intriguing story that had me on the edge of my seat for the entire run-time. It is a film that trusts its audience has been paying attention to everything that is going on, and if you have been watching carefully you will be blown away by the ending of this film.

Considerado um clássico quase que instantaneamente após a sua saída no Festival de Sundance, o queridinho dos cults, a obra-prima do canadense Dennis VILANOVA, ou novinho da vila pros íntimos, que cada vez mais vem se provando um dos mais versáteis diretores do novo século. A sétima arte, mais do que simples forma de entretenimento, servem para alimentar e atiçar o aprendizado do público. Há filmes que são para o seu divertimento, há filmes que são para o seu aprendizado e também há filmes que tanto te divertem quanto te proporcionam um êxtase consistente de sentimentos diversos, desde o encanto com os belos gráficos, a bela história ou as explosões mirabolantes que acontecem há cada frame, ou àquele sútil, mas impactante, acontecimento que muda totalmente a sua compreensão da obra e te faz, como um soco no estômago, soltar um evasivo ""PUTA QUE PARIU"" no meio da sala de cinema. Dennis Vilannueve, o Dedê, é capaz de misturar todos os seus sentimentos como se fosse uma vitamina matinal que a sua mamãe fazia quando você ainda era apenas uma sementinha (do mal). Em A Chegada, o diretor da terra do Wolverine nos entrega uma ficção científica consistente, um scifi raiz, que trata o tema ""invasão alienígena"", se é que podemos chamar disso, com total maestria como Van Ludwig fazia em suas sinfonias. Contestando uma coisa que nunca havíamos parado para pensar antes, A Chegada fala sobre o que aconteceria se os alienígenas não quisessem matar todo mundo, conquistar o mundo e preservassem as populações de mosquitos e sim batessem um papo, trocassem um lero, passar um reto pra humanidadez? Seríamos devidamente humanos, no sentido cool da palavra, e estaríamos abertos para aprender e conhecer uma nova forma de vida ou cagaríamos com tudo como sempre fazemos? É óbvio que você já sabe a resposta. Centrado na Doutora em Línguas Louise Banks (Amy Adams, a Lois Lane hipster), o filme começa com um flashback da vida da doutora antes da invasão. Em cores quentes, fortes e vivas, os flashbacks mostram cenas onde ela vivia feliz com a sua filha, Hannah, até o momento de sua inevitável morte pelo câncer (acredito eu). Divorciada e sem muitas esperanças, logo somos levados à universidade onde a moça leciona, em um dia normal da realidade estadunidense. Percebendo a constante agitação de seus alunos e das pessoas no geral, a Dra. Banks suspeita que algo está acontecendo, e logo descobre que estranhos ovnis, apelidados CARINHOSAMENTE de conchas, apareceram suspensos no ar de 12 locais diferentes espalhados pelo mundo, inicialmente aleatórios para nós. Um deles, como sempre, se encontra numa remota área industrial de Montana, nos EUA, e o governo americano parte para tentar controlar o ovni e descobrir o que eles querem. Eles chamam a Dra. Banks, parceira de role deles desde quando teve que traduzir pelo Google Translate um vídeo terrorista, e o Doutor em Física Teórica Ian Donheiler (Clint Barto... Ops, Jeremy Renner, o Hawkeye), e dão liberdade para ambos trabalharem entre si e desvendarem não só o dialeto como as características alienígenas. Aparentemente, vemos Banks como uma mulher fria, sem demonstrar muitos seus sentimentos e nem falar muito sobre o seu passado obscuro. O diretor utiliza da ótima fotografia e edição para criar um clima angustiante, pesado, afinal estamos falando de uma mulher que perdeu a sua filha e, muito por isso, não tem mais aspirações para continuar vivendo. A relação que Ian e Louise criam juntos, apesar de aparentemente desnecessária e clichê, se torna muito importante para o desenvolvimento do filme no mais tardar. Com o passar do tempo, vemos como os esforços da Dra. Banks e do Dr. Donheiler são jogados no lixo quando o caos e a desconfiança para com os alienígenas vem crescendo com as ações militares dos governos chineses e russos - sempre os comunistas. O General Shang, muito citado pelas mídias televisivas, se mostra o grande responsável pelo twist que temos no filme, e agora é hora de falar dele sim, porque O CARALHO DESSE PLOTWIST É GIGANTE! Meua migo, vamos começar. Se você não entendeu o filme, te indico procurar no Google porque eu não pretendo me estender no assunto, e acredito que resumir tudo seja um puta contragosto e desrespeito ao filme. Em certo momento do filme, vemos que em um dos flashbacks de Louise, ela fala com sua filha enquanto está pondo ela pra dormir, respondendo a pergunta quanto ao nome da menina, dizendo que se trata de um palíndromo. Palíndromos, como vocês claramente sabem já que não mataram a aula de português para dormir nos seus dias de contraturno, são palavras que, lidas de trás pra frente, apresentam a mesma forma de escrita do que lidas na forma normal. É o caso de Arara, de Ana, de SOCORRAM-ME SUBI NO ONIBUS EM MARROCOS, e por aí vai. O que vocês não devem ter percebido é que, na verdade, ali a Dra. dava um puta spoiler do que era o filme. Sim, isso mesmo. O filme todo é um palíndromo. Com o passar do tempo, descobrimos que quanto mais Leslie se aproxima dos heptapodes, os alienígenas do filme carinhosamente apelidados por Ian de Abott e Costello, e mais entende sobre o seu dialeto, mais ela se torna capaz de ver as coisas como eles e, assim, dominar a sua linguagem. Mesmo que exagerado, Louise passa a entender que os signos exibidos pelos alienígenas, que aparentemente eram apenas letras, significam muito mais. São formas de enxergar o passado, formas de entender o tempo que, para eles, não funciona de forma linear. Para nós humanos o tempo funciona como se fosse um rio, com começo e fim. Um tempo não-linear é uma esfera. Ele não tem fim, ele não tem começo, ele pode até não ter forma e funcionar de maneira desconhecida, sem a noção de passado e futuro. Os alienígenas, heptapodes, possuem olhos em todas as pernas, incrementando ainda mais essa ideia de não conseguirem ter noção de ""frente"" e ""atrás"", como nós temos. Os símbolos, esferas com uma ou outra característica distinta, representam o tempo para os aliens, sem início início e sem final. Os alienígenas em questão questão são capazes de enxergar o tempo de uma maneira não-linear, mais precisamente como uma esfera, aonde não existe um passado nem um futuro. Tudo acontece o mesmo tempo, seja o seu nascimento ou o seu casamento. A doutora Louise, ao começar a entender isso, é capaz de não só se comunicar normalmente (falando sua língua nativa) com os aliens como também ter um maior controle sobre as suas visões do futuro, as quais achávamos até o plotwists que eram do passado. Nisso, o filme nos revela um dos maiores e melhores plotwists do scifi na minha opinião, ao tratar com maestria a forma como o tempo não é preciso e como os seres-humanos precisam estar evoluindo sempre, seja no seu modo de lidar com povos estranhos ou no seu entendimento do universo. Ao final do filme, o que temos é um mundo parcialmente unido, em comunhão. Os governos agora são todos amiguinhos, como calouros e veteranos nas primeiras semanas de aula, e tentam juntos entender e crescer com a experiência que tiveram com AS MÃOZINHAS DEMENTADORAS. Literalmente, foi preciso o espaço dar uma mãozinha (ou duas, ou duas vezes doze) pros humanos pararem de ser cuzões.

5.0,"'Arrival' is a masterpiece-it was, it is, and it will be. 

This film balances the alien sci-fi element with its motifs of unity and balance. The language of the aliens shows the power of balance. We see balance between individuals (e.g.: Ian and Louise), balance between countries, and balance between the sciences (e.g.: numerical methods and linguistics). These balanced converge on the main thesis: a balanced worldview, in which we make decisions seeing the end from the beginning. 

This movie involved me on a deep emotional level, and makes me want to be a better person. But on to the technical side. The pacing was excellent-it keeps the viewer involved throughout. The accurate linguistics and scientific analysis delighted me. The governmental decisions were understandable, though often frustrating (this was deliberate-I was grateful for the point they were making). The visual effects were well done and not overbearing. The use of time was clever and enjoyable, reflecting the theme well.

Arrival is well-informed and pays close attention to the tiniest details and clearly consulted plenty of experts. Character development is portrayed realistically with believable relationships and interactions, politics is as complicated as it is in reality with a frightened and war-centered human race taking center stage, language takes on a large role with plenty of interesting insights to how humanity would tackle an unknown language and understand it. Science also plays a part in decision making and in instigating the curiosity of the audience. The film is thought provoking and demands interest in a diverse array of fields to truly be appreciated, as the film instigates many questions. To top it all off, the film doesn't forget to add symbolic elements to the film and get audiences thinking both realistically and imaginatively.

If you knew something bad was gonna happen, if you knew someone was gonna suffer, of course you'd change it... and if you can't change it (because the past, present and future have already happened) then existence is pointless.

5.0,"Easily one of the best Sci-Fi films of recent years, this cerebral piece of film-making is beautiful, delicate and intelligent, and will certainly get you thinking.
The premise - 12 mysterious alien craft touch down at various locations around the globe, and tensions and paranoia mount between nations as humanity struggles to work out what the visitors intentions are.  
Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner play the two leads assigned to work with the military to investigate, both give excellent performances, Amy Adams in particular.
The film is devoid of any 'action', and instead focuses on communication; the importance of it, the lack of it, and painfully highlights where we as humans are failing in that respect, with regards to our relationships between nations.  It shows that if we act from a mindset of fear and paranoia - as we often do - that bad things generally follow.  Powerful, and very poignant subjects.
I would recommend this film to anyone.  I found myself still thinking about it hours after watching it.  It's not going to be for everyone - I get that - its pacing requires you be patient with it, and I can see some folks getting bored that it doesn't build up to some big-budget hollywood climax, but that suits me down to the ground.

However if you have a good story you should not cheap out on less than average lead actors.

3.5,"Finally got to see Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" with my wife.  I think his movies are great, so I was looking forward to this one.  This was a slower paced SciFi with limited CGI.   The pacing was more like the movies ""Contact"" and ""Interstellar"".  It's about ideas and an important one is about language.  How the world responds to the 'arrival' of aliens is complicated  by our language diversity.  So the story's tension revolves around this problem.  There's a another important aspect in the story arc that is more mind-bending.  No spoilers.  It was pretty good, I thought.  My wife needed a debrief afterward.  She gave it only  5.  A seven from me.  The pacing seemed off at times.  Beautifully filmed, interesting sound,  solid acting by Amy Adams.  For his first SciFi effort, pretty good.

4.0,The concept for this movie is quite original and I am very thankful to Hollywood for finally trying something new. Although it may not seem new on the face of it because of movies like contact this one is different in that it actually shows a realistic process of us trying to communicate with aliens. Instead of the aliens just somehow magically knowing English we actually have to translate their language in a neat and creative way. This movie is not perfect though as there are some cliche tropes that are in first contact movies such as trying to get humanity to cooperate and not kill each other. It is offset though by the humans actually resisting that though and acting as humans would do if this were a real situation. Given the run time I understand that there would have to be some limitations on showing the actual translation process so the montage of them getting past all the middle area is fine although I would have preferred to see more of this as the figuring out how to talk to the aliens is the main thing that sets this movie apart from all the others. In addition I thought the ending could have been done better. I didn't really like the whole time thing they decided to throw in and I would have much preferred that they had just left that out entirely as it didn't really add much to the film in my opinion and it took away from what I thought made the movie good.

This is the premise of Arrival (not to be confused with similarly named Charlie Sheen film), an adaptation of the short story ""The Story of Your Life"" and the latest film from Sicario and Prisoners director Dennis Villeneuve, which is already another fine addition to his solid track record. This is a thought-provoking and emotional human drama/sci-fi film that is sure to captivate viewers and raise important questions while not succumbing to Hollywood conventions. Amy Adams is amazing as the film's lead who is haunted by memories of her past, which aids her in her task to communicate with the visitors, eventually learning more about them as well as herself with surprising results. It might be slow for some viewers, but, hey, that's y'all's problem. I loved this movie. lol.

3.0,"The majority of 2016's crop of best picture nominated films underwhelmed at the box office, but the thought-provoking sci-fi drama 'Arrival' struck a chord with audiences in a way that few others in the genre have in recent memory.
 
The film, which revolves around 12 mysterious alien spacecraft that land across Earth with unknown intentions, is a smart piece of cinema thanks to its themes of the concept of time, loss and the notion of language as a unifying force. This sets it apart from many less serious sci-fi offerings that have been heavy on action and an ""us vs. them"" mentality rather than curiosity and discovery. 'Arrival' is also helped out by beautiful cinematography thanks to the rural Montana setting and an ominous soundtrack that fits the on-screen actions like a glove.
 
From an acting standpoint, Amy Adams chocks up another Oscar-worthy performance as renowned linguist Louise Banks (it's a shame she was not recognized for this role), while Jeremy Renner joins her as a cocky scientist. The two have chemistry together and are believable as they try to help the U.S. government get to the bottom of why the aliens decided to park their spacecraft on our planet. Forest Whitaker does a respectable job as a a tired, by-the-books colonel who oversees the mission.
 
While some who are not paying attention could understandably get lost in the plot, due to the non-linear timeline that is used, everything more or less makes sense once the credits roll. This is why 'Arrival' has won so much acclaim - it doesn't spoonfeed audiences and asks that they put in a little bit of effort to think about the messages that are built into fabric of the film. For this reason, director Denis Villeneuve ('Prisoners,' 'Sicario') deserves a lot of credit, along with the writers, for bringing it to life.
 
'Arrival' will not win best picture at the 89th Academy Awards, but it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who enjoys smart, dramatic thrillers.",Mike D,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Feb 26, 2017",Mike D,/user/id/799076554,RT,799076554,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1823978/picture
3.5,"It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.

The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.

The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.

When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.

To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.

1.0,"This just wasn't that good. At all. I mean, good visuals (what doesn't have those anymore?), ok acting (it's not like post 2001 has had a plethora of this, anyway, so what's the meter of comparison?), and a lousy script. I don't get the hype behind this director, he failed to connect on so many levels in ways directors like Gilliam, Gibson, or even [*gasp*] Nolan has done on more than a handful of occasions. 

Truth is, the idea behind the plot isn't terribly bad, but the movie literally does not build up, does not climax, and the denouement that should be there is replaced with a ""revelation"". Much like ""Inception"", I'm afraid viewers are just too afraid to openly admit they didn't get the whole spiel in lieu of this era's fear of looking stupid. 

I admit it, and am proud, actually. I don't care if that makes me a dum-dum, it doesn't bother me one bit. This movie was just laaaaaaaame and I knew it was ending about 10 minutes before it ended, and was waiting for some sort of pick me up, some sort of non-philosophical bullshit, for some sort of real humanity to the entire ordeal. Instead, it fizzled out with some lame excuse for a ""reveal"" (welcome to the 21st century filmverse, overhyped shitastic millennial fodder). I spent the final ten minutes looking up what this film was even supposed to be about, and the explanation was so simple (and by the time I'd read it, I could ""experience"" it with full knowledge of what was to come) that I figured this was some sort of indie-flick-gone-popular mishap (see: Garden State), but I'm more alarmed to see this is the genius director being heralded by the idiots of the world these days. As if Nolan wasn't a cop-out excuse, now we have this villenawhatever to thank for the next 3 films YOU MUST SEE.

I simply reiterate: today's populace is shitstained scared of looking remotely defunct at understanding something that, well, we're told is just the ape's testicles (erhem...bee's knees). Why on earth would tripe like this ever exceed 80%, I'd expect something like this to barely scrape a 50/50. I mean, I'm pretty sure I had more fun for longer at Batman V. Superman...and we all know what that was like. At least I got to see Wonder Woman.

4.0,"I'll admit, I had preconceived notions of a film with most of it's genius in the cinematography, but this view was ultimately toppled. I'll keep this short, I love how this film is constructed. At the start it confuses the viewer with vague imagery of our main protagonist Louise, and what appears to be her daughter, but never does it show a father though he is mentioned. We also learn straightaway that this daughter dies of an illness that initially seems cancerous. From there the plot slows; we get a long period of time where we learn of Louise's background as a linguist and her recruitment to decypher the language of newly arrived extraterrestrial life. The first time we see them write in their language, it appears as a partial circle, but everytime it's slightly different to denote a different collection of words. But here's the kicker, and remember this, Louise talks of how their language is this sort of endless loop that circles back on itself. The aliens eventually reveal that they want to gift their language to humanity so that in 3000 years humanity might return the favor, because they will need help. Curious as to how they know the future, Louise soon learns that the gift inherent in the language is the ability to see into the future. The dreams she's experienced all throughout of her daughter are visions of the future that have yet to occur, but she's begun to see them because she has started to learn the language. In an attempt to read many of the aliens' ""circles"" at once, she sees into the future and reads a book she wrote on translating their language. We soon learn how Louise saves humanity, and possibly the future heptapods and also learn who the child's (in the future visions) father is, the other specialist Ian. The movie ends with Ian asking Louise if she wants to make a baby, and plays the same song as it did at the beginning, Max Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"". Therefore this movie ends the same way it begins, and forms an endless loop, much like the alien language the heptapods gifted to the human race. On top of all this, Johann Johansson's spectacular score utilizes a conglomerations of many different vocal singing methods, which is quite fitting for a movie centered on linguistics.",Andrew M,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Feb 24, 2017",Andrew M,/user/id/938234077,RT,938234077,

Amy Adams, delivers a heart wrenchingly beautiful performance. This movie is more about Amy than aliens. Director Denis Villeneuve sometimes gets lost in repetition and some will pick and poke at the films slowness, but in a film about large ideas, shifting universal perspective, and some unforeseeable surprises, a slower, thoughtful atmosphere is appreciated. This is a more thoughtful, more intelligent sci fi film than the mainstream usually offers. Arrival keeps its mysteries at bay and doesn't dissapoint when all is revealed.

4.0,"We've been lucky enough to have had some excellent science fiction films recently-Interstellar in 2014, and last year's Best Picture nominee, The Martian in 2015-and Arrival is among them. Those films, like Arrival, are not just fantasies, they are pro-science. The main characters are scientists or science minded people that use available information and resources to solve incredible problems. To borrow a phrase from NASA, they ""work the problem."" This is what Amy Adams does as Louise Banks, a world-renowned linguist tasked with figuring out how to communicate with recently arrived alien beings. She doesn't have much time, as the mysterious alien spaceships have appeared all over the world and world governments are nervous and frantic to figure out why the aliens are here. 

You're likely to be reminded of other science fiction films about ""first contact"": Close Encounters of the Third Kind (in which François Truffaut also tries to communicate with aliens), Contact, and The Day the Earth Stood Still to name a few. The alien spaceships might even remind you of the monolith in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The aliens themselves look like creatures from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. But Arrival is far from derivative; it is the perfect example of what should happen with a new entry to a well tread genre. We've seen movies about aliens arriving on Earth before, but we've never seen one quite like this. 

There are of course visual effects and computer generated images, but this film does not center around effects or spectacle. At the heart of Arrival is an incredible performance by Amy Adams that was inexplicably not nominated for Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards. Adams excels at using small facial expressions and her eyes to convey clearly, but quietly what her characters are thinking and experiencing and that's exactly what she does here. Her performance makes the character of Louise relatable and grounds the entire film in genuine emotion even as it moves into heady sci-fi territory. We have no trouble believing that Louise is the foremost authority on language and are frustrated when military and government officials (played by Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg, respectively) stand in her way or won't listen to her conclusions. We are with her every step of the way, even if we don't know what it all means. 

Even though Arrival does not go out of its way to simplify or explain itself, it never becomes inaccessible and only becomes more intriguing and entertaining as the story unfolds. Did I understand the intricacies and logic of Arrival's climax? I think so. Regardless, I understood what was happening well enough to be thoroughly satisfied and moved emotionally. The Oscar nominated cinematography by Bradford Young and score by Johann Johannsson contribute greatly to the movie's tone and along with skillful direction by Denis Villeneuve, a smart screenplay by Eric Heisserer, and, perhaps most of all, an amazing performance by Amy Adams elevate Arrival from just another science fiction film to something profoundly affecting.",Armando G,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Feb 24, 2017",Armando G,/user/id/784622113,RT,784622113,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10905656/picture

5.0,"Effective and mind-bending are the best words to describe ""Arrival."" Every detail director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer has done with the film, such as the story and the mystery, is remarkable and well-put together. For that, I cannot wait to see how director Denis Villeneuve would manage to pull off with his next film, ""Blade Runner 2049."" The score by Johann Johannsson is nicely done. Beautifully shot by Bradford Young's cinematography, just the amount of colors that surrounds the whole movie so memorizing. But most of all, this movie belongs to Amy Adams. Pretty much everything she does (especially when she's around with Jeremy Renner, which I thought these two make a really great team) is extraordinary. This is probably the best performance of her career so far. The only compliant, for a lot of people, is the resolution. It seems like they found it to be either weak or confusing. In my case, I pretty much understood the resolution, and to be honest, it really grabbed me, even when it's heartbreaking to watch.

5.0,"One of the most themes in science fiction has always been mankind's first encounter with an extra-terrestrial species. In most instances, particularly during the Golden age of the monster movie, the aliens that our species encounters are not usually the friendliest lot in the galaxy. In many cases, they are out right belligerent hideous bodies making them stronger, faster and smarter than us. Movies like 'It Came from Outer Space,' 'Invaders from Mars' and the far more subtle episode of the Twilight Zone, 'To Serve Man.', there has never been a shortage of first encounter stories. No matter what form they took your objectives are usually clear; they wanted some resource that we had going to turn our lush, blue planet into a smoldering cinder. Began to change with a particular movie in 1951, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' established the concept that an alien race capable transverse thing unimaginable distance of space does not do so just to annihilate us. As a general concession to the audience was remarkable about the aliens were able to understand English, supposedly by monitoring our radio signals for years. Finally, a science fiction movie has come along that is unique so far. 'Arrival,' is another in a long line the first encounter films with quite a difference, the protagonist of the story is linguistics expert, indicating the primary objective of the military and government agencies involved in making contact is determined to make a realistic effort at meaningful communication. This movie is a groundbreaking example thanks to a production objective to induce the audience to think. There is a notable absence of epic battles. No futuristic alien fighters are zooming around the sky targeting our most treasured landmarks, homes and places of business in innocent victims by the score. Gone is the usual segment of the film with scientists from all over the world unite, putting past jingoistic concerns behind them, to repel the invaders from the stars. The individuals are setting the foundation for first contact, not military men of exalted rank but rather people with PhDs and a penchant for thinking out of the box. The result was a film of rare excellence, one that helps to redefine this particular subgenre and also the crafting of science fiction movies. Epic battles for the survival of humanity; visual extravagance are replaced here by a dependence upon cerebral commitment on the part of the audience.

Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's foremost authorities in linguistics. The scope of expertise goes beyond the mere understanding of languages and how they interrelate to each other; her interests extend into a profound understanding of the fundamental constructs of the language and how it facilitates communication. Louise is haunted by dreams of a great tragedy, the death of an adolescent daughter who succumbed to cancer. What is most unusual is that the reason is not to have a child, but divisions are exceptionally real. She has a robust respected career in academia as a university professor. One night at home she is a mystery by helicopter to some unknown location. Last few days the news has been completely overwhelmed by one, the most important one in the history of humanity. Over 12 seemingly random spots in on Earth, extraterrestrial space crafts have arrived, hovering motionless over the place. The one in the United States is in a remote area of Montana and as Louise soon is informed on opening appears on a regular schedule that allows humans and opportunity to approach the extraterrestrials remain within a sealed chamber with a transparent wall. On the other side of the partition, two members of the alien race that are similar in some way to the octopus accepted seven limbs. The name given to them are heptapods, but on nicknamed by the human observers as avid and Costello. Louise is brought in establish some communication so as to ascertain the alien's intention. Try to understand some of the highly advanced technology another specialist is brought in, theoretical physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). United States military remains in charge commanded by U.S. Army Colonel G T Weber (Forest Whitaker). Col. Weber is not openly hostile to the sciences, but he repeatedly reminds them that this is a military operation, and he is indisputably in charge. Unlike the unyielding military types in most other first encounter films Col. Weber is very willing to help the scientist as much as possible and is not the impediment to the academic approach that had been de rigueur in the traditional movie of this category.

Recovering from their initial contact with the aliens, the Louise and Ian begin to formulate a plan to gather the necessary information. Ian realizes quickly, but the best way to learn about the technology is to let Louise take the lead in establish communication. The preferred method of building a few rudimentary vocabulary words is initially met with some resistance by the Colonel, but he quickly comes to see the wisdom of her decision without developing a rudementary set of terms the potential for misunderstanding could be disastrous. Upon reentering the visitor's chamber, Louise finds heself stymied, unable to find common ground for simple objects. Discarding every safety protocol, Loise strips off of protective environments and in pointing to herself repeats, 'Louise,' encouraging the alien emulator. One of the truly imaginative aspects of this movie is how the special effects team devised a method of communication for the heptapods. A seven digit 'hand' at the end of one of their tentacles that emit a black almost ink like substance. That material forms a ring against the glass with numerous bumps and markings. After a few sleepless nights of intense concentration realizes that the complex circular symbols are its core vocabulary. Feverishly working on collating the findings Louise comes up with a program for her tablet that she can use to create simple sentences.

With a primary means of understanding established Louise can open a dialogue with Abbott and Costello. Translations are still tenuous with only basic meanings associated with the words that are still lacking contextual nuances, becoming evident when the aliens communicate the phrase ""offer weapon."" All the nations around the world have been engaging in similar lines of research and investigation including the People's Republic of China. They become confident that an attack is imminent in sharing information between the 12 sites is abruptly halted. Louise determines that the aliens' concept of time is far different from theirs. What they have interpreted as a weapon is 'gift, ' and all troll parts are necessary for the complete gift to be known. Louise begins to experience flashbacks and flash-forwards, indicating that the aliens do not exist in our concept of the present, but their consciousness encompasses time itself. Theestablisment of the requisite sword of Damocles occurs when governments, including the United States, tend to use nuclear weapons against the ships. Unless Louise can contact the aliens once again and convince them that she understands the gift, an unprecedented disaster will befall planet Earth.

The film's director, Canadian Denis Villeneuve, is making his entrée into the science fiction this movie. 'Sicario' is an action-packed story concerning the drug war for many of his other offerings a very intense premise. It seems that he is taking a liking to science fiction since his next film the highly anticipated 'Blade Runner 2049'. Working from a screenplay provided by Eric Heisserer based on a story ""Story of Your Life"" written by Ted Chiang, there is never a moment that the audience feels anything less than being engaged in the story. Formally that is decidedly cerebral rather than visceral is incredible just how well a level of excitement is established and expertly escalated throughout the duration of the film. This is most definitely not a movie to watch in the background. It demands and deserves every iota of your attention. Considering the artistry and craftsmanship that went into the production, you will gladly commit yourself to every frame of this movie. Many firms have to be repeatedly watched to understand what is going on. While multiple viewings deepen your understanding, you want to experience the film times just for the sheer enjoyment.

This movie is a visual tour de force, as captivating as it is enigmatic. The audience may have a façade that could be considered the monstrous way they are depicted with the special effects confers upon them but undeniable sense of intelligence, and underlying sentience unlike the mind this brutality exhibited by the extraterrestrials of our youth. There are numerous plot threads typical of a mystery driving this story. There is a hopeful almost gentle feeling about the interactions between Louise and these emissaries from another world. Ms. Adams is one of the most eclectic actresses of her generation. She has a range and depth that is only recently given proper showcases conducive to its blossoming. While delightful and romantic comedies that form the foundation for career films that she has appeared in such intense the emotional roles as 'Doubt,' 'the Fighter and 'American Hustle' Intermixed with lighter projects including 'Enchanted,' 'Leap Year' and 'the Muppets.' It is exceedingly rare for doctors to be able to effortlessly between such cinematic extremes. This movie showcased her talent and an incredible and unique fashion allowing the audience to appreciate how thoroughly Ms. Adams can become the character she is portraying. In the persona of Louise, Ms. Adams portrays a woman facing the most monumental challenge of her professional career. He is called upon to use every tool for trade that she acculuated over years of academic theory. Still, she demonstrates that were the Louise's greatest talent was channeling her humanity to find common ground with extraterrestrial creatures.

When movie aficionados give a name Jeremy Renner, the mantra immediately focuses on one of his most iconic characters, Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He plays a member of the Avengers not imbued with supernatural powers, or exceptionally advanced technology's primary function is to humanize this group of superheroes. The very nature of this type of movie is hardly conducive to a highly detailed back story, although a concerted effort has been made to expand upon his home life. In this film, Mr. Renner is finally given a showcase to exhibit a far greater range of possible this action oriented roles. This is not the first time audiences have been afforded the opportunity to witness the amazing range of this active. Nominated for the Academy Award for best performance by leading man in the 2008 movie 'The Hurt Locker.' It is also important to note that his leading lady Ms. Adams herself was nominated no less than for five Academy Awards, four for supporting actress and one for leading performer. While on the topic of Academy Awards this cast does most a renter for the category 'best performance by in a leading role,' Forest Whitaker. But many excellent actors Mr. Whitaker spent a significant portion of his early career as a character actor he gained a unique understanding of the nuances of humanity and how best to convey a large range of emotions with portrayals.

'Arrival' is not just a rare science fiction was a gentle approach to a perennial favorite theme; it stands as a groundbreaking example of the cinematic artistry of telling a compelling story. I realize that there are people who have a problem with the dénouement, particularly in a scientific theory that is used to form the foundation of the conclusion. Even if you are unable to accept the scientific veracity of this plot point should not allow her to diminish from your appreciation of the entire film. Formal ludicrous plot contrivances have been used in many films of exceptional quality.

2.5,"In my opinion the movie performed poorly. It was a disappointment. The subject of language and communication and how it was addressed by the writer was brilliant. But the script was rather poor. It felt like the book wanted to focus on the character and her psychology while the movie focused on the Aliens, thus making the character only marginal to the main storyline.
Not much character development either, apart from the endless dullness of the main character, which in the end has no major impact on the main story, that is the ARRIVAL of the aliens. The movie spends a awful lot of time creating a mystery mood that leads practically nowhere. Although i initially liked the suspense, in the end it was not justified. The gloomy mood of the movie was also not justified by the peaceful nature of the aliens nor how it ended. There was no sunshine in the end, no hope, no better future. Just more dullness. 
The love relationship between the two scientist comes out of nowhere and it leads to nowhere. There is no positive change and no finale, neither in the movie nor in the way events are supposed to end. We see a person with a dull life who has a brief moment of joy and ends up with a dull life again. What's the point?
Although the overall design, graphics and mood was really good, all the cool things the aliens represented ment for nothing. They didn't change anything, save anyone or made a visible impact on earth events. The title is misleading. It should have been titled ""First contact"". It would have made much more sense.
The chinese antagonism is also a big overused cliche. So lame to make the chinese aggressive when in fact they are known for their pragmatic and patient diplomacy. And what for? The chinese decision to attack is not justified. It is based on the assumption that the chinese are hostile by default, thus fueling more stereotyping. The los of cooperation with the European allies is also lame. Everyone knows the USA and the EU will never antagonize each-other.

4.0,"This is one dark movie. Very dark. Need a flashlight dark. It adds to the gloomy, ominous tension, in the latest alien encounter Hollywood blockbuster. Here's the good news: instead of turning into some crazy CGI battle zone, ""Arrival"" keeps on keeping on with the intellectual storyline, which as it turns out, is pretty damn engrossing.

Clever is just the start here. ""Arrival"" is brimming with original, quirky, brain-teasing quandaries on various levels of the human experience, and how an alien intrusion could turn everything we know upside down.

Not only is the narrative quite delicious, but the circular unfolding of events, the inventive communication mysteries of another life form, and the questioning of scientific knowledge, is revelatory.

5.0,"This movie made me make an account.  One of the best I've ever seen.  If there are logical flaws, they're not particularly obvious which can't be said of many films touching on the concept of time.  There were at least a few points I did not see coming at all, and honestly the way Amy Adams manages to portray her character's decision at the end, and it was one of the heaviest I've seen in a film, was Oscar worthy, there's no doubt in my mind.  One thing that I thought was really cool is something not explicitly stated in the movie, but in my opinion comes through as pretty obvious, just a warning this next portion will contain spoilers.

When she's standing in front of this behemoth of an alien being toward the end, completely in awe of it.  It is also looking down at her with awe and respect.  Remember, Humanity at some point down the road is powerful enough to save them.  To it, Humans are probably just as intimidating and awe-inspiring as she believes it to be.  Watch the two from this perspective and it really makes for an incredible display.

The only way I see you finding this movie as anything short of a masterpiece is if you don't appreciate puzzle-solving in its various forms.

3.5,"Arrival is the vastly overrated, but very well-made science fiction tale about alien spaceships who arrive on Earth seeking our help, and the fate of humanity rests in the hands of an accomplished linguist who learns how to communicate with them. This film is less of an alien invasion story and centers more on the themes of communication, linguistics, and fate; a cool concept, but to me, the execution left much to be desired. It's directed by Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Forest Whitaker who all deliver solid work, but the storytelling and pace put me to sleep. Critics are raving that this is a ""thinking-man's sci-fi"", which I'm all for, but not at the expense of entertainment purposes and this film was a DRAGGGGGGG to get through. Adams and Renner have very little chemistry throughout; her character being extremely bland didn't help, and I was largely unsatisfied with where their characters ended up. The pacing is also unbearably slow which left an air of self-importance around the film that honest-to-goodness, made me fall asleep while watching it. The big reveals that come at the end are admittedly very cool, but once again, the execution of said ideas is very uninteresting and were not nearly as mind-blowing as the movie thinks they are. I REALLY wanted to love this as I'm a big fan of the director's work, but perhaps the enormous praise this film got and massive hype surrounding it worked against my expectations by the time I finally saw it.

1.0,"This movie was a sci-fi that wanted to soar but that fell down to earth with a very dissapointing thump.  It addressed lofty sci-fi questions about the nature of the universe; the relationships of humans to each other; as well as what a possible relationship with aliens might look like.  Just when you think that the movie is going to have an illuminating and profound message that calls humanity to be the best of itself and stretch beyond normal limits of possibility with a dazzling complexity of future/present/past time and choices; and you think that despite all of the technology and math the movie has dwelled on, that relationships are what truly matters.  Relationships that show a depth of caring even for aliens that seem difficult for humans to relate to, as they are very uncomfortably alien in nature.  But then there is a twist in the plot that renders the main character ironically less human and compassionate than the aliens, despite a sudden amazing talent that manages to save the day.  She makes a choice which seems to be incredibly selfish and disregards any personal pain and suffering she brings to those she supposedly loves, in a decision that she makes over and over, despite knowing the painful future outcome.  It is questionable why this is the territory the movie wanted to navigate when it is hard to see that she is making this decision out of anything but a selfish love.  The outcome of her decision is questionable and controversial - and renders this character completely unsympathetic and unlikable, destroying any heroic sense you might have had of the character.  The aliens seem more compassionate and loving, ironically, than this character.  Overall, the movie's message is muddled - it can't seem to decide what is truly important - technology or relationships.  In the end, the main character's decision renders her own future pointless.  She may have saved the planet, but she cannot save herself from a loveless and compassionate-less future.  I don't think that this is the message that the movie was going for.  It deliberately tries to confuse and muddle its own plotlines to obstruct people actually figuring out what Amy Adam's character was deciding and why.  The movie leaves a depressing taste in your mouth. Why give a character a power which renders her powerless?  Or is that the point?  I like profound sci-fi, but not sci-fi that twists itself into knots just to turn a success into a defeat.  Yuck.  Next time I will watch Galaxy Quest for the tenth time instead!   This movie makes Space Odyssey look cheerful!  Even Interstellar, despite its anti-climactic and somewhat disappointing ending, had a dram of hope left in it and a positive sense of love and compassion driving it - which this movie ""Arrival"" completely lacks.",Sue O,False,False,False,False,1.0,"Feb 18, 2017",Sue O,/user/id/922390456,RT,922390456,

The movie starts out with a few flashbacks involving this main character and her daughter - no explanation of who she is - what happened to her daughter - why there is no husband(or significant other) - you know the normal things that make you connect with a character.
Then all of a sudden - some government/military guy is coming to whisk her off to talk to aliens based on the fact that she once translated some Farsi for them? Jesus - it's just nonsense. After 40 minutes I turned to my husband and asked - are you getting ANYTHING out of this movie?
Nope - not at all. I can suspend belief fine when I can at least connect with the characters so I care about them - but I could have cared less about anyone in this movie.

2.0,"Visually stunning. Science fiction film noir world destruction! Camera and lens work is worth an oscar. It's a beauty. 
The movie, not so much. 
From the beginning we hear Amy Adams scolding
 her mom for watching 'that news Channel'!  The 
channel goes unnamed but when she deals with the 
government rep (Forrest) she hints that the terrorists she translated into English weren't so bad. In real life ms Amy has been kind enough to loudly share her belief that given her mucho experience playing dress up and pretend, makes her one more of the underfeed chain smoking royalty who wants us to only vote the Hollywood way. Much more of that and many of us will just take a year off from new movies.
A's said here, the movie moves slowly. It's sci-fi. It works mostly.
The end is well hidden until the last little bit. The ending pulls it together pretty well. This movie will do well in reruns, and on rainy days.
However (spoiler) I could not get past one certain scene. Amy and Jeremy Renner (a mathematician) both push the rules, and go up alone to try to better understand the aliens plans, are they bad visitors or are they good green guys? Someone plants a bomb with. There they are with a bomb, about to die with the aliens, unaware of the bomb, in the space vehicle. Green guys know; they blow the earthlings down the hall, close a protective door, save Amy and Renner lives and selflessly absorb the blast in the craft!
You'd think they'd be mad, how it got there, why it got there, who got it there, why kill the scientists, who ordered it, etc.

5.0,"It is difficult to find ways to critique a film like this where so many aspects of what it means to make a great film can all be found in Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"". 

With a story that is centered around the idea of communication, writer Eric Heisserer brings to the screen a daring example of humanity's unwillingness to work together and fear of the unknown. Told by Villeneuve in an amazingly introspective way, the story of Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) presents a hyper-realistic narrative of the importance of cooperation and the sciences (and cooperation in science), and the perils of selfishness and fear-mongering. Something as simple as talking to each other has so many nuances that most of us never consider or realise. This is a heavy, thoughtful movie no doubt, and through it all is threaded the simple and repetitive yet heady score of Jóhann Jóhannsson. The circular structure of the music, the themes, and of course the aliens' writing too, ties everything together beautifully into this well-rounded story.

5.0,"Arrival is a film that opens your mind to lofty concepts such as the nature of time, geo-political affairs, and of course, language. 

The plot, stripped down, is about a woman named Louise whose life purpose is to receive 'the universal language,' from the aliens who visit earth. She passes the language on to humanity in a mass produced book called The Universal Language.

In Louise's communications with the aliens, we see the theme of time recur again and again. The aliens write in sentences that are wrapped in symbols, all of which resemble a ring, or more accurately, an ouroboros, which is a snake eating its tail. This ancient symbol represents the cyclical nature of time. Birth, life, and death is a repeating cycle. 

But the story introduces us to a new way of thinking about time. Perhaps a less pessimistic way. In the story, the words ""language"" and ""weapon"" are used interchangeably by the aliens in such statements as, ""weapon opens time."" And ""use weapon."" Alternately, ""language opens time"" and ""use language.""

And the caveat the aliens give humans with the gift of the universal language, is that in 3000 years the aliens will need the humans' help. For what, we don't know. 

What we do know is that the two greatest task we face as humans are 1) curing aging, and 2) interstellar space travel.

Inteligentan i provokativan, prati pri?u o dolasku vanzemaljske civilizacije na zemlju, sa kojom treba uspostaviti prvi kontakt. Ulogu spasitelja, gle ?uda, ima ena. Dosta. Utopijski  san o ujednjenju ljudske rase, spremne da u budu?nosti spaava i druge svetove. Kao vreme iz Epa o Gilgameu, u kome majka glavnog junaka, ?ini herojsko delo, ujedinjuju?i svoga sina, okrutnog vladara Gilgamea, sa svojim ljutim neprijateljem Enkiduom, ne bi li postao bolji ?ovek. Izuzetno. Gluma Amy Adams maestralna. Svedena, senzualna, blaga. Mater dolorosa. Predvidjam Zlatni globus za koji je nominovana kao tuma? glavne uloge i jo ?itav niz nagrada. Ipak, pri?a ne bi bila spektakularna, da uz onu vanzemaljsku, ne nudi jednu istinski ljudsku, toplu i strasnu. Oplakivanje smrti k?eri i pronalaenje ljubavi svoga ivota, koja je i izgubljena radi nerazumevanja. A glavna junakinja je, o ironije, po profesiji ?uvena lingvistkinja ?iji zadatak jeste da stupi u prvi kontakt sa vanzemaljcima. I pored vidljivih geografskih i jezi?kih greaka u komunikaciji na kineskom mandarinskom ili postavci 12 vanzemaljskih lokacija po na izgled nepovezanim stratekim ta?kama sveta, film obiluje mnotvom izuzetnih umetni?kih i nau?nih veza. Od muzike Maksa Rihtera, koji je oven?an nagradom za najboljeg evropskog kompozitora, do literarnog predloka koji je posluio za scenario. Re? je o kratkoj pri?i Teda Chianga Pri?a tvoga ivota. Autor je ina?e jedan od dobitnika nagrade Hugo, koja se dodeljuje decenijama unazad za dela spekulativne fikcije i spada u najzna?ajnije u svetu. Film obiluje inteligentnim asocijacijama i oma je mnogim drugim umetni?kim delima, od onih iz sveta filma (Abot i Kostelo su imena vanzemaljaca sa kojima komunicira heroina ) do onih knjievnih kakva je novela o Tripodima Jhona Christophera, jo jednog autora iz anra sci fi. Ono to film ?ini istinski uzbudljivim je ?injenica da je ljudima za komunikaciju izgleda potreban vanzemaljski susret, to je kao tema ve? pokrenuto u kultnom Avataru.Ipak, meni je najvie panje privukla teza koju neguje film, a ti?e se jezi?kih teorija.Junakinja  kae da je sve u jeziku, uz  pretpostavku da postoji sastavna veza izme?u jezi?nih kategorija i miljenja. U filmu se jasno anticipira Sapir (ameri?ki lingvista) Whorhova (Sapirov u?enik) lingvisti?ka hipoteza koja, iako nikad  napisana kao takva, zaista nudi miljenje obojice nau?nika. U antropologiji je formalno nazvana tako, posle njihove smrti. Oba naucnika su za ivota ispitivali odnos izmedju miljenja, jezika i kulture. Danas se ta teorija koristi u biznisu. Ta hipoteza tvrdi da postoji veza izme?u jezika kojim se realnost opisuje i samog opaanja, tj da jezi?ki kod uti?e na kognitivne procese, pa u skladu sa istom razli?ite nacije imaju razli?it odnos prema stvarima, pojavama, vremenu, novcu i tednji. Govornici razli?itih jezika u istim drutvima, sa istim socio-ekonomskim parametrima - dohodak, obrazovanje, bra?ni status, broj dece.., imaju razli?ite preferencije ka tednji, na primer. Dakle, ipak je sve u jeziku, to ja negiram ve? dugo vremena, bahato se razbacuju?i savrenim poznavanjem maternjeg ali i vremena, koje je najvaniji faktor za razumevanje filma.

4.0,"It's amazing how far sci-fi, as a film genre, has come since its inception.  From Metropolis, which is recognized as the first feature-length sci-fi movie in existence, to Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the entire 50s sci-fi renaissance, as it were, to 2001: A Space Odyssey.  From there on you have Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Matrix, District 9, Inception, Ex Machina.  The genre has certainly seen its ups and downs, particularly when it comes to films focusing on aliens arriving on earth.  There aren't many movies, at least as far as I can tell, that focus more on what this situation would REALLY be like.  It wouldn't play out like the Independence Days of the world, where the aliens declare war on humanity and we've all got to take a stand against them.  The first film, I believe, that really took a look at this from a more real-world standpoint would be Close Encounters, who looked at the arrival of the aliens as something to marvel at.  It wasn't a scientifically-driven movie, in the least, but it was a movie that looked at the wonderment such a event would attract.  Which is where this movie comes in.  And I know Contact was released TWENTY years before this movie, but I don't really remember much of it.  But I digress, for those thinking that this is gonna be another Independence Day, where humanity is at war with aliens, then they'll be sorely disappointed.  This is an intelligent, thinking-person's sci-fi.  The film sees a linguistics expert attempt to figure out the alien's language in order to figure out what they want, why they're here and how they got there.  But, of course, it's not just as simple as that, as there are twelve heptapods, as they call it, spread out through the entire world.  There are heptapods in Russia, Pakistan, Sudan, Venezuela, China, UK, Australia, among others.  So figuring out their reason for being here is, really, a worldwide collaboration.  But, of course, with countries like Russia and China being involved, their talks with the aliens in the heptapods are a little more sensitive in nature.  Particularly when you take into consideration that the aliens, who have their own complex language, might not understand the meaning of some of the words they use or the context with which someone like China or Russia might view them in.  For example, there's a scene where the aliens communicate to Louise to 'offer weapon', there's a big deal about that, because the government is unsure of whether they want weapons, if they're offering a weapon or if they would like to do a trade.  Things are further complicated when some of the soldiers on base, having been fueled by stupid conspiracy videos (imagine InfoWars or some other bullshit) plant some bombs inside the heptapod in order kill the aliens.  It doesn't work, of course, and there are a few moments where it seems that a worldwide conflict between humanity and the aliens is imminent.  The film isn't about that, this is about avoiding war at all costs.  The film takes a really interesting and thought-provoking approach   Reviewing this film is tricky, because I want to avoid spoilers, but the film focuses heavily on Louise's family life.  You get to see flashbacks of her life with her daughter who passed away from cancer in her teen years.  The way the movie plays with those elements, which really make up the emotional core of the film, is one of the more pleasant surprises the film has in store.  There's also some fairly intriguing theories around language and how fully immersing yourself in learning a new language will re-wire your brain into thinking differently.  That's definitely one of the biggest themes in play here.  The perception of time is also very important to where the film wants to go.  I feel that, by its conclusion, some people might feel that the narrative got a little convoluted, but it's not a movie that betrays its own rules.  It doesn't take established concepts and do away with them in order to force in a deus ex machina.  Again, reviewing all of this is really tricky when you're trying to avoid spoilers, but it's all exceptionally well-done.  As if it wasn't obvious by the review, I thought this was a pretty damn great movie.  The film is rich in storytelling, that's for damn sure, and how it incorporates Louise's past life (something to keep an eye for) into the events that are occurring in the present.  How her memories help guide her hand in dealing with the aliens, whom they name Abbot and Costello, and how she helps to avoid an international conflict against the aliens.  In spite of everything though, the movie never really seeks to make out Louise to be a heroine, she's just doing what needs to be done.  Because of that, her character feels grounded to earth, you can still relate to her in spite of the fact that, really, she was the one of the biggest parts in avoiding this conflict.  And I say that because other countries had to follow China's lead.  They could have just refused.  But the world 'uniting as one', as it were, is due to Louise and her knowledge and understand of the aliens and their language.  The ending itself is really quite bittersweet, because of what Louise knows.  I won't get into details, I don't wanna spoil it, but it's worth a look regardless.  Amy Adams is phenomenal here, no ifs, ands or buts about it.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Ms. Adams carries the movie on her shoulders and she delivers a home run.  It also helps when the film has a strong a script as this one, but she never slacks off.  Movie's beautifully shot as well and I didn't even rent the Blu-Ray.  I can't really say much else about this movie.  I thought it was great and I would easily recommend it.  It's not the best movie I saw from 2016, The Wailing would take that honor, but don't let that, and the fact that this is a dialogue-heav sci-fi flick, dissuade you from giving this a shot.",Jesse O,False,True,False,False,4.0,"Feb 15, 2017",Jesse O,/user/id/1202249,RT,1202249,

If you watched this hoping for AN ACTUAL SCI-FI MOVIE you'll be sorely disappointed. If you were hoping for a tragic love story then you've come to the right place. The aliens that JUST HAPPEN to be in this movie are only a means to an end. The alien/sci-fi aspect of this movie serves no other purpose whatsoever than as a catalyst to one random person's love life. A love life BTW that didn't even have a happy ending as they separated and the child died! So aliens come to the earth and all they do is give one person the ability to see the future, and all the impact it has on humanity is their love life?  I was wondering why the movie came out on Valentine's Day and now I know. I'm sorry but when aliens come to earth I expect them to have a grander impact on humanity than this movie portrays.  This might be a decent movie if it wasn't trying to pretend it was a full fledged sc-fi epic.  It's more of a scirom (sci-fi/romance) or scidra (sci-fi/drama), both of which would be a new genre. I don't know if I'm missing the whole point to this movie or what but I'm having a hard time understanding how any sci-fi fan could like it.",Tom B,False,False,False,False,2.0,"Feb 15, 2017",Tom B,/user/id/976068812,RT,976068812,

1.0,"Two hours of what can only be described as the absolutely worst, drawn-out, confusing and pretentious Sci-Fi movie ever put out on digital acetate.  And the folks at 21 Laps Entertainment have you believe this ""blockbuster"" cost $99 million to produce. Oh Lord, someone pulled the digital layers over our eyes. If you read the positive movie reviews raving about how artsy and intellectual this is-  then please consider these movie critics are delusional and intellectually fake.

Let me state The Arrival is nothing short than overrated On many facets, the movie falls totally over the cliff, As I was watching this unravel during 112 minutes, i challenged myself that the best was yet to come, . This Arrival in my opinion ranks as being one of those undiscovered genres all by itself. Heck - even Harvey Weinstein couldn't have cocked it up that bad. But here we are boys and girls. Wow...So to the folks at The Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences and to esteemed members of the BAFTA, its very likely you won't see my nomination being sent in anytime soon.  Very sorry guys. 

All things said, digitally enhanced and scored, it's a total piece of crap and please forget the hipster rave reviews about how amazing the plot is and how warm Amy Adams acting was. Remember the phrase - The Emperor has no clothes? - Well, don't fall for it boys and girls. I had more fun watching my delicates spin-dry in my new Samsung tumble dryer. Oi Vey. My better half challenged me to see beyond its main plot and to read more into it. Sadly I gave up looking for something that simply wasn't there in this flick.

But wait, there was a moment - the Producer and his team decided to throw a couple of cheap tricks used at the end of the movie to explain what is so unexplainable. Denis, It doesn't pass the smell test. At the half way mark, I already felt ripped off. On top of that, the script hides the relationship between some of the characters. Like I said, the whole thing makes for a confusing ending for the average moviegoer, like myself. It's almost like you need a movie whisperer or a Cliffs Notes aide to help you figure it. And no, I wasn't expecting Sigourney Weaver or some epic battle either.

On a positive note, what I did like was the 12-pod style looking spaceships - it fueled me to see what would happen. The idea and design was novel, the spaceships seemed intriguing, but sadly we don't get to see anymore of the inside of the spacecraft. Somehow I wanted more, I wanted to roam inside the darkness of the labyrinth. But no, the digital team could have added to the ideation palette here but didn't. And so, rather that, the movie instead took considerable time trying to get me hooked on the decryption of the aliens rorschach ink-blot-like language. 

Underlying this, the viewer quickly senses there are communication gaps amongst some of the 12 countries who each have an alien spacecraft hovering in it. The Chinese are cutting themselves off from peace talks, so too are the Russians, then the Americans....oh Gosh, it sounds like they were fearful of some wall being built. 

Was this one of the messages I needed to take away? That people will agree to disagree or was it to think about how Amy Adams ""Hannah"" and the overall movie was essentially a Palindrone - spelt backwards it could be viewed the same both ways? Regardless, Amy also boasts a top secret clearance as a linguistics professor and tries everything through mental flashbacks to befriend the shadowy aliens hidden in the mist, trying in vain to figure out their language - or was I missing the point it that .

To that end, I propose the film producers seriously consider dusting off their Arri Alexa or CineAlta cameras and get something better off the ground for a movie that cost $99 million.",Jason C,False,False,False,False,1.0,"Feb 15, 2017",Jason C,/user/id/866624592,RT,866624592,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/582793637/picture

4.5,"I first saw Arrival at its sneak preview last Feb 7th. Then I saw it again this morning with my sister. Denis Villeneuve, (Prisoner, 2013 & Sicario, 2015) has beautifully directed this film that keeps you on edge of your seat.

Plot: 12 mysterious gigantic spacecrafts have landed across the globe. Linguistic professor joins a US army team to learn aliens' language and communicate with them to to know what they came for.

The film opens introducing Louise Banks (played terrifically by Amy Adams) and her daughter Hannah, where her name is palindrome which means it is said the same forwards as well as backwards which kinda gives us a clue how the movie ends. Before she was asked to join the army at one of the locations in Montana where one of the spacecrafts has landed, the government has been able to interact with alien visitors in some forms, but they couldn't translate the sounds. Louise couldn't translate the strange noises from the audio file brought by US Army Colonel G T Weber (played impeccably by Forest Whitaker) she said, she has to be there for her to communicate with the aliens directly. 'Language is a foundation of Civilization', which is probably one of the most memorable lines I heard in a movie in years. We also met Ian Donnelly (effectively played by Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist who helps Dr. Banks to study aliens' language.

There's a huge question in this film, Why are they here? Are they here to invade us or to help us? Every 18 hours the spacecraft opens to let them temporarily interact with aliens directly. The aliens are known as heptapods because of their 7 legs or tentacles. Because it is impossible to communicate with aliens through the sound they make, Dr. Banks came up with an idea to communicate with them visually. She writes her name on a white board to introduce herself while Aliens communicates by making symbols with distinct patterns and shapes. Dr. Banks was having flashbacks, moments with her daughter that were shown in the film many times. As the session goes on, the more they get ideas about their intentions along the way.

Arrival is beautiful is great in its own right. It film doesn't rely on visual effects but it gives us stunning images that takes your breath away. Plus the chilling score from Jóhann Jóhannsson who composed movie scores from (Prisoners, Theory of Everything & Sicario) and Max Richter. They uses different tones in the film that are truly haunting and unsettling to hear. But that doesn't end there. The ultimate twist of the film comes when Dr. Banks realizes that she sees future. Those flashbacks she had were not memories from the past but events from the future which explains everything we experienced watching the film. The way it was told in the film makes it compelling to watch.

Arrival is unlike any other psychological/alien-invasion or sci fi films we've seen that keeps us guessing how it's going to end but it is a dramatic take of humans' first contact of the third kind. It's a type of movie that invites you leaving the theater and actually talking about it. I was engaged by every inch of this film. I walked out and I thought a lot about it. It works on you on ways you're not really aware of.

4.0,"With his debut Incendies in 2010, Denis Villeneuve really hit the ground running and has been one of the most consistently interesting director's for the last 7 years.  There's a host of films and genres that Villeneuve has explored in that time; from the nightmarish surrealism of Enemy; his unflinching kidnap thriller Prisoners and his drug cartel action drama Sicario. If you put aside his forthcoming Blade Runner sequel, you could say that Arrival is his science fiction warm-up to attempting to re-engage with that much loved classic.

Plot: 12 mysterious, alien spacecrafts land across the globe with the whole of mankind questioning their intentions. Expert linguistic Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is hired to attempt to communicate with them. In the meantime, frustrations are leading earth to a global war and the answers Louise begins to decipher could mean the difference between saving or eradicating humanity entirely.

The renowned astrophysicist and author, Carl Sagan once wrote ""The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff."" This is a theoretical topic that courses throughout Villeneuve's film and, at one point, even referenced directly. 

Based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of your Life"", Arrival is not overly concerned with being a big-budget science fiction film. It certainly has these elements (and they are very well executed) but it's more concerned with mood, atmosphere and exploring the very nature of our existence through language and our relationship and understanding of time and space. In doing so, Arrival has much in common with Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film Contact (which itself was based on a book by the aforementioned Sagan). Both use the form of extraterrestrial communication as a device to understand ourselves and it's this communication angle (and the reveal that results from it) that eventually turns Arrival on its head. It's an angle that has split some viewers; is it too clever for its own good? Does it disappear up its own wazoo? Or is it a clever sleight of hand that questions our linear and literal perception of events? I'm siding with the latter but these questions are better left to the individual viewer. 

What can be said, is that Villeneuve has done his homework on this. Much like Christopher Nolan's approach to Interstellar, Villeneuve extensively ensured the film's scientific ideology was accurate by enlisting the help of renowned scientists and tech innovators who advised on all the terminology, graphics and depictions. As Villeneuve is in no rush to tell his story, he demands a patience and a willingness to open up to the films theories and possibilities. It can often be a bit weighty and does occasionally tread a fine line between absurdity and suspending your disbelief but there's much to ruminate over and Villeneuve is aided immeasurably but his cast and crew; Bradford Young (who previously impressed me with his work in A Most Violent Year) delivers some stunningly captured cinematography and Jóhan Jóhansson's score perfectly accompanies the mood and imagery. At the forefront, however, is a quietly effecting performance from Amy Adams. She brings such subtle emotional depth that she contributes hugely to your ability to buy the films premise in the first place. It's a performance that I'm very surprised has been omitted from this year's academy awards. 

I struggle with the 'masterpiece' label that has been thrust upon Villenueve's film but there's no doubt that Arrival is a delicate, thoughtful and accomplished piece of work. If he applies the same level of intelligence and challenging material to his Blade Runner 2049 then the continuation of Ridley Scott's master of the genre may well be in good hands.

4.5,"Exceptional movie! 

Much like Titanic was not a documentary about the ship and its eventual sinking, but instead a love story about Jack and Rose... Arrival too is not a story about aliens and first contact as much as it is a story about the human condition and the power of love.

Rarely can a writer or director pull that off, but where James Cameron did it quite successfully with Titanic, Denis Villeneuve and Eric Heisserer have successfully done it here.  The sci-fi, while interesting and thought provoking to say the least, is just a backdrop for the story of Amy Adams character.

If there are so many people complaining that should be Amy Adams nominated instead her, maybe I should see the movie to confere if they're right. And no! Amy Adams wasn't bad, but comparing with Meryl Streep if like comparing a turtle with a horse in a ride! Meryl Streep was a lot better. But this is a review about the movie not about Meryl Streep. This movie is a garbage. (Spoiler Alert after here). The story basically consists in a teacher that is recruted to try comunicate with aliens, she can do it. The conclusion about the movie is that her visions that we think that are about the past are about the future. I was hoping for some good material, because this has a nomination for best picture.

2.0,"Spoiler Warning!!! Not really if you already have see this type of film before. 
The movie Arrival is one of the most boring films I have seen all year. This is a genre which I call sentimental scifi. Meaning that we have a scifi film which is really just genre that tries to garner empathy for a character. I have to say I was not convinces with Amy Adams' role in this movie. She is too one dimensional, and by the end her character along with the whole story does not make any sense. 
The plot is about language and communication. Therein lays the problem. Spielberg already did it with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and that film was genius. Spielberg did not need to over complicate things. He shared the concept that music is a universal language that could be used to communicate with the aliens. The main character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an every day man who is chosen to experience something far beyond his imagination. Arrival uses a know it all scientist with amnesia to try and translate circles. The aliens use her memories to convey a message, ie Interstellar, and the movie Contact. The dialogue is cliche military talk, and stuff pulled from movies such as Contact, and Independence Day. The only thing great about this film was Jeremy Renner's acting. He is awesome in just about anything. The music is really good. The special effects and cinematography are top notch. This film would look excellent in 4k. The main problem is the writing.

5.0,"Despite all the mindless action and sex that hits the big screen every year, every once in a while there comes a film that's a little more . . . cerebral. Arrival (2016) certainly fits this category. Not only do you really have to pay attention to what's happening in this film, it makes you question how we perceive our world as it is right now. Never before have I seen the topic of encountering alien life forms approached from such a realistic and logical way. It makes sense that we wouldn't be able to understand them, so the first step in establishing an understanding is to establish communication.

Much like Christopher Nolan, who has done a number of great, ""cerebral"" films including Memento (2000), Inception (2010), and Interstellar (2014), I have recently come to appreciate the directorial talents of Denis Villeneuve. From his previous films like Prisoners (2013) and Sicario (2015), I've seen him deliver powerful messages about who we are as humans and how we deal with evil. In Arrival, once again the enemy is humanity itself, and the angry and violent mistrust it has against anything it doesn't understand. Fortunately, despite its repeated visual motif of black and white, Arrival shows that peace can be found in the gray area of language interpretation.

While I don't want to give away the twist of this film, I have to say that the way it was presented certainly makes for a powerful impact once it has been realized. I will simply attribute this to the talent of Denis Villeneuve and the superb screenplay used to guide the audience along to the stunning conclusion. If you haven't seen any of Villeneuve's films yet, now's a great time to start. I certainly will look forward to his next piece, if this is the type of work he's putting out right now.

3.5,"Arrival is the movie that Interstellar wanted to be. It takes a sci-fi topic, tries to ground it in actual science, and weaves in an emotional core to the film without compromising the science. It's important to mention that Arrival is deliberately paced, and by that I mean it moves slower than molasses. I tolerated the plodding storyline because I was totally invested in Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. They add a lot of heart to this movie and make it work well for me. I loved how the movie explained some of the linguistics and the understated way they handled effects was brilliant (aside from one scene where the effects were poor.) The reason it didn't rate as highly for me as many other sci-fi films was two-fold. For one, they fast-forwarded through a large chunk of the language discovery and that was one of my favorite parts. It was a strange choice, in a movie that had so many slow moments, to rush through anything so intriguing. The other thing that bugged me was the fact that I guessed what was going on well before it was revealed so the second half of the film played out without much surprise. It's not a huge flaw for a movie to be predictable, but in this case I felt like I was missing something when they revealed certain things and I already expected them. Aside from my little complaints, Arrival is a very good movie, and I can see why it was so highly regarded. It's one of those hard sci-fi movies where the ending leads to all kinds of deeper questions that can't really be answered, but you feel like you might be able to puzzle it all out with more viewings. I didn't love it as much as I anticipated, but it also didn't disappoint me all that much.",Ben L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Feb 10, 2017",Ben L,/user/id/855043855,RT,855043855,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1077523731/picture

4.5,"WHAT I LIKED: I don't think you can truly appreciate how different and innovative 'Arrival' is until you see it, because literally everything here is entirely fresh and unexpected, and delves underneath everything we think we know. For a start, the story itself looks below the very essence of the challenges we'd likely face when literally interacting with aliens, which is something I've never seen or even considered in a movie before. In turn, this allows for the exploration of some very fundamental themes that again, tend to get glossed over in film. All in all, this makes it a genuine eye-opener; shining the light on the systems we take for granted, and suddenly making us acutely aware of the very basis of humanity's function - not just communication and time, but also love and life or death. It's all the more despairing and gripping then, to see the world rip itself apart as it tries to deal with these concepts, as you're equally struggling with the monuments level of careful consideration and reflection this movie demands.
It could have easily felt void of emotional heart though, and with Villenueve on board that was definitely a big risk, but Arrival actually has huge emotional weight thanks to  a brilliantly layered lead who's arc is intertwined with the overall story to truly invest you, and translate the overall concepts it tackles. Couple that with a very well-realised set of world building aided by unsurprisingly incredible cinematography and visual effects, as well as a very appropriate score - the result is an experience that makes you invest ten-fold and think an awful lot indeed.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The set-up could have been slightly more elegant in its pacing, but at least it cuts to the point quickly.
VERDICT: From the genre, to humanity itself; 'Arrival' is a film that delves underneath everything we know, and the result is Villenueve's best film. That's not just because its themes are so powerful though; this thing's got soul, too.",Barney o,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Feb 08, 2017",Barney o,/user/id/970920626,RT,970920626,

5.0,"A few disclaimer statements up front about Arrival:
1) From the trailers first scene last year, Arrival kinda looked ""interesting"" but not interesting enough for me to get my butt onto a cinema seat to see it either at TIFF or when it was first released in November of last year.
2) For those whom I spoke to who did see it, some liked it.  Some had to give it a few shots to get through it all.  Others didn't ""get it.""

3) Since it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, I had to go see it (to make first hand, informed opinions on what should win best picture).
4) I've seen just over half (5) of the 9 best pictures and ....

5) Arrival would HANDS DOWN be my pick for best picture!  Without a doubt!   Arrival's intricate, Memento-ish, holistic awe and wonderment builds by implanting questions and ""WTF is going on""ness for three-quarters of the movie until the completely mesmerizing and ""Are you serious??"" shocking twist happens.  The last 20 to 30 mins is when either your mind gets blown off, out, all over the theatre or you go ""I don't get it.... what just happened?""
6) Amy Adams was absolutely riveting and captivating.  So much that she was definitely smacked in the face with her Oscar snub for Arrival.  She was dark and gothic-glam in Nocturnal Animals (the best thing about the film was her).  But her performance in Arrival was flawless.  Whether she would have beaten out Emma Stone in La La Land, who knows.  But she HANDS DOWN deserved to be there (in a category where I've only seen one best actress flick - Stone's La La Land).

A short post disclaimer review:

Obviously I cannot ruin the twisty surprise. Which means I can't give too much away or what ""clues"" or ""insight"" to lookout for.  Just keep in mind that Canadian Denis Villeneuve (who - in one of the rare post-movie credits ""Behind the Scenes"" segment - had always wanted to do Sci-fi) jumps into the ""mind""verse of Christopher Nolan a la the previously mentioned Memento and Inception.  
Villeneuve's previous pictures have also been psychologically engaging; from the likes of the dark dark but mindducking Prisoners, to the political military insurgent Sicario.   He will also be handling Blade Runner 2049 with Ryan Gosling.  Villenuve's handling of the masterpiece Arrival is no different.  The colours are subdued and toned down.  The camera always seems to be and keeps moving (it's rare a scene is ever stationary).  His Montana landscape shots are beautiful and expansive.  His incorporation of the global alien arrival drop zones with news media footage is seamlessly integrated and provides a greater scope and foundation to the ""us versus them"" political and military phobic terror.  Yet Villenuve's emotional captivation handling of the radiant performance of Amy Adams as Louise is so touching, traumatic as well as eye opening, it fits in so influentially within the international ""big picture"" directorial scope and vision.
Speaking of ""fitting,"" I give a standing O to editor Joe Walker for weaving a non-linear timeline into a perfect final product; where scenes that originally made you think ""why is the movie jumping around so much"" or ""what was that scene truly about?"" make you have a completely different revelationary reaction towards the end once the twist is revealed.  The twist ONLY works because of Villeneuve's detailed and ""non""abstract (in the end) filmmaking and Walker's editing.
However, even the two of them couldn't have made the movie so profound without the masterful contributions of others: such as cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma) and music/score composer Johann Johannsson (who worked on Villenuve's previous films Sicario and Prisoners as well as the Stephen Hawking movie The Theory of Everything).   I would highly recommend to stay around for the behind the scenes doc, as it will truly put you in awe of Young and Johannsson's involvement and contribution in making Arrival spectacular.

EVERYONE on the film deserves kudos and their fair share credit; even down to costume designers (for the quarantine garb) and the special effects gurus (in handling the hetapod aliens; the exterior and interiors of the space ship; and Adams' final interaction scene with the alien).
Forest Whitaker as Colonel Weber is apropos, and Jeremy Renner is also fitting as Ian as his storyline evolves (when he and Adams' have their truck tailgate chat, I was like ""Why is his character even being focused on as he truly doesn't seem to be contributing anything?"") and how it integrates into Adams' Louise.

5.0,"I usually enjoy Sci-Fi movies, the ones that give you something to think about. When I saw the arrival I was scared that it would be an ""interstellar like time related movie"", damn I was wrong.
The arrival tells the story of a linguist - expert who is sent to communicate with aliens who have landed on different parts of the worlds. The movie shows the process of understanding their language and also why they are on earth.
What appealed me the most was the music. It is so well timed and it matches perfectly the characters' feeling. Sometimes it is just a few notes but it is enough to amaze the viewer.
The story is told beautifully, the mystery around the aliens fades gently during the movie and the spectator slowly understands the plot and some elements from the beginning. The only negative point is the finale which was a bit too fast for my taste.
I enjoyed the philosophy around the language. The fact that they think differently because of the aliens' language and also that they can perceive time differently with it. Great discussion subject!

This alien, a cross between an oceanic giant hand and an octopus, showed no violence, which was a welcomed change from most Hollywood films.  But this movie missed human connection somehow.  Ian was supposed to be this top scientist, but the film TOLD us that; they did not show us.

It's super intriguing, its story is fascinating, Amy Adams is so captivating with one of her best performances ever, Denis Villeneuve's direction proves to be perfect once again (one of my favorite directors of today, if not the favorite), the soundtrack is rememberable and the movie looks stunningly gorgeous, with beautiful cinematography. A deliberately slow pacing might bring the movie down for some people, but for me, it's right on point. A sci-fi masterpiece.""

4.0,"I started the film thinking this is like Space Odyssey and finished thinking this is as anti as can be.

In my interpretation of Space Odyssey, the monolith represents human nature, which is beyond good and evil. Is using a bone as a weapon to drive rivals away from the water hole good or evil? Neither because it is human to want to ensure our own survival.

In Arrival, monolith x 12 is here to unify humanity. Personally, I think things worked out because the aliens worked with 12 nations independently. If they only sent one monolith, they would not have had the opportunity to test 12 different approaches. Yes, different people doing different things will create conflict and conflict will create winners and losers at least in the short term. In the longer term, the rival ape men might find a bigger water hole elsewhere.

In terms of cinematography, I loved every moment of Arrival. So I'm sort of hoping that I misunderstood the message and the film is not suggesting that we all unify around THE RIGHT ANSWER. Otherwise, I think Arrival represents everything that is wrong with the world.

As a scifi fan, I really expected this to br an awesome film with things blowing up and war, human development beyond what you could imagine, or something in between. Add space to that equation, and you have nearly every scifi film give or take the plot, which makes them better.
Now here, you have a decent idea that's spread throughout half of the film, which was not a good use of time. The idea being that aliens come to earth and a linguist uncovers the meaning, but since they don't experience time they basically know everything. THEN they spend the next hald of the film with a whole ""I ACCEPT THE FUTURE"" and ""I AM GOING TO HAVE A BABY AND GET MARRIED"" stuff.

4.5,"Science fiction films tend to stratify into 3 categories, in my mind. The most commercially successful are really just adventure films set in a science fiction universe. These focus on action and fantasy, with futuristic or high-concept elements. They leverage classic story archetypes and superlative visuals to produce enjoyable escapism. Star Wars is the exemplar of this sub-genre, and although Star Trek aspires to greater scientific rigor, it belongs here too.
 
The second set similarly uses science as a backdrop for noir. These are the darker films, the dystopian adventures. They may not be as hopeful or as fun, but they tend to be more pointed. These films typically propound on a ""what if"" premise, plumbing the dingy depths of possibility. The best are often imaginative, twisted interrogations of human nature or society. This is Blade Runner, The Matrix, Dark City.
 
Finally, there are what I like to call ""thinking"" films. They are headier, and explore ideas that fundamentally change reality or alter our perception of it. They eschew spectacle and adrenaline to allow the audience to dive deep on a single premise. These films are typically smaller in focus, slower, often centering around the journey of a single character. Usually less accessible movies, Hamlet might opine that these ""pleased not the million, (but) 'twas caviar to the general"". I would count 2001, Interstellar, K-PAX and others as ""thinking"" sci-fi. Arrival fits securely in this group.
 
Arrival is a big budget take on a small story, focusing almost myopically on Louise, a linguistics expert who is conscripted to help communicate with extra-terrestrial beings who arrive suddenly above the Earth. Her journey of consciousness as she learns to comprehend the aliens serves as the plot, using the events of the story more as context than narrative. Director Denis Villeneuve deftly uses arresting visuals and frank, realistic sensibilities to relate a story that might otherwise be esoteric. It's fantastic elements are believable because of his steady hand, and even the few quibbles i had in hindsight melted away while watching the screen.

4.5,"while there are elements of ""alien invasion/human misunderstanding"" this is actually a pretty unique spin on the genre for Hollywood. It has a deliberate pace and the learning to communicate with the aliens feels earned rather than easily granted. It's also unsettling in places (with the slightly distorted dreams) and the bending of physics can get a little trippy in the final act so that while the aliens may not appear threatening their representation of the unknown still is. I'd read the short story the film was based on over 15 years ago and feel the executed the language and other revelations pretty well. Villeneuve has gone up in my expectations as a director, showing he's not afraid to leave gaps for the viewer/actor/scenery to fill. Amy Adams is on a roll of late taking on varied work and quickly becoming an actor whose presence in a film has me interested. Renner doesn't really get that much to do which is a bit of a shame but nice to see him do something different from special-ops guy. He's actually pretty good at the everyman role.

3.5,"It is hard to truly comment on the film without including spoilers, but I will do my best. 

Arrival is a film that I find I am forced to wrestle with rather than simply appreciate. To be honest, I am still not entirely certain how I feel about it. It is a good film, to be sure, but I remain conflicted about how good it actually is. I count myself among those who were able to predict (at least somewhat) where the film was heading about half-way through, and so my experience with the film became less about measuring the wow factor of the initial surprise of the ending and more about noting the ways in which it manages to piece the narrative together. 

The heart of the film is in the question it poses, and it is the nature of how you respond to the question (which is drawn out of the film's poetic finish) that I think will impact your overall experience of the film and it's characters. Adams plays the professional linguist professor Louise Banks, who gets pulled into an investigation of these mysterious pods that have appear rather suddenly in 12 different locales around the globe. Right from the film represents this investigation as a global concern, an element of the story that becomes increasingly important to the developing tension. What we know of Banks from the get go is that certain traumatic events have played a role in bringing her to the love of linguistics that she is now being asked to give in service to this global push for answers- why are they here and what do they want? 

Adams gives a very good performance, really giving herself to the sort of patient unveiling that the story demands. Arrival is an intelligent Sci-Fi that moves slowly but with great intention, and Adams expertly navigates the pacing by making good use of the space the film affords her to kind of linger and play around with different emotions. It becomes very clear early on that this is a personal journey for her, one that is going to pull out some different conflicting emotions, and Adams ensures that, as an audience, we are able to take this journey with her. 

This film has been defined in other spaces as the next ""Contact"". Here is where the tension likely begins and ends for me. I loved that film. I liked this one. And yet what I loved about Contact is the pure sense of awe that it inspired in the moment. Arrival didn't garner this same level of emotion, for whatever reason. What Arrival did do, though, is manage to linger. The more I consider its central question, the more it seems to pull me into the experience of the film. There is something about the way it managed to do this (and continues to do this) that separates it from Contact in a way. The central question of Arrival is far more specific and intimate than the more generalized reflection (of faith and meaning and the expansiveness of the universe) that Contact evoked. And it works to Arrivals benefit. 

So by no means is Arrival a mediocre film. It is a very good film. Does it belong in the best picture category? Does it deserve all of the nominations is has managed to garner? I am not sure. Even though any film is this to some degree or another, it feels like Arrival remains that much more of a specific and subject experience. Which means it should make for some enriching discussion and dialogue (in most circles), but it also might render it somewhat allusive in the realm of that subjectivity.",Dave C,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Feb 02, 2017",Dave C,/user/id/782095644,RT,782095644,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/639740663/picture

5.0,"Arrival (La Llegada) es una interesante, aterradora, conmovedora y muy relevante película de ciencia ficcion, imprescindible para cualquier amante del genero. Dirigida por uno de los mejores directores de la actualidad, el canadiense Denis Villenueve, es una muestra de ciencia ficción inteligente que no necesita alardear de grandes escenas de acción y efectos especiales.
 El film se centra en la llegada de los extraterrestres a nuestro planeta y los esfuerzos de un equipo encabezado por la lingüista Louise Banks                       (Extraordinaria  Amy Adams)  que tiene la labor de aprender a comunicarse con ellos para determinar si sus intenciones son hostiles o pacíficas. 
'La llegada' es una película sobre la importancia del lenguaje, el miedo a lo desconocido y a provocar un grave conflicto por no comprender a nuestro receptor. Del mismo modo que las anteriores excelentes películas de Villeneuve (Prisioneros , Enemy y Sicario), la película es al mismo tiempo compleja, oscura y misteriosa. (Con muchas ganas de ver ya su proxima pelicula que seria la secuela del clasico de ciencia de ficcion ""Blade Runner"").
 El ritmo de 'La llegada' es deliberadamente sobrio, el espectador recibe la información que necesita justo en el momento adecuado para ir atando cabos al mismo tiempo que la protagonista. Como un reflejo de cómo funcionan muchos puzzles, la película se fragmenta más cuanto más se acerca Louise a averiguar por qué los alienígenas han llegado y qué quieren de nosotros.
Técnicamente, la película es una maravilla. La próxima comparación se va a convertir en un tópico del que vamos a terminar aburridos, pero tanto la música Johan Jóhannsson (tremendamente emotiva, pero también sensorial y oscura, apegada a los espacios que acompaña), como la fotografía de Bradford Young (rica en texturas y en elecciones muy concretas de la luz, como un guión que subyace entre las palabras), remiten a atmósferas y estilos del cine de Kubrick. Arrival, siendo tremendamente realista, contiene misterio, tensión, incógnitas que no son tramposas. En conclucion Arrival es una maravilla, muy merecido sus 8 nominaciones al Oscar, hasta me atrevo a decir que merece ganar el premio a mejor pelicula, la unica injusticia es que Amy Adams se quedo sin Nominacion.
En conclucion pelicula imperdible y perfecta, no apto para el publico que esperan solo mucha accion y efectos especiales de peliculas de invasiones extraterrestres.

3.5,"""Arrival"" starts off as a great sci-fi film (in the vein of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""Contact"") grounded in reality. Unfortunately, the narrative of the movie ends up falling apart 3/4ths of the way through when an M. Night Shamylan-esque twist is thrown into the plot. It does pay off in a clever way towards the end, but the line of logic to getting to that point is convoluted at best, shoddy at worst. It took me completely out of the movie, which I was enjoying otherwise. While the other actors in the ensemble (including Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker) are given little to work with in terms of shallow characterizations, Amy Adams is terrific in the lead role (and definitely deserved a spot on this year's ""Best Actress"" Oscar list).

4.5,"Denis Villeneuve nos deja evidenciado una vez más quién es. Después de grandes filmes como ""Incendies"" y ""Sicario"", nos plasma un trabajo cinematográfico que sin duda formará parte de la mejor herencia del Sci-Fi. Hasta el momento ninguno de sus trabajos nos ha dejado sintiéndonos incompletos o inconformes con tan elaboradas cintas llenas de investigación, sustento histórico y apego a la realidad; ""Arrival"" no es la excepción y definitivamente entra como parte de las mejores películas del 2016. Se trata de una excepcional obra maestra en la que se reúnen varias temáticas que apuntan a diversas conclusiones, pero nunca perdiendo el hilo central y conector de esta elaborada y genial historia. Miedo, asombro, sorpresa, confusión, valentía y ternura son muchas de las emociones que ""Arrival"" nos deja y en las que nos envuelve. 
La ciencia ficción ha sido un área tan amplia, tan experimentada y, sin embargo, tan incomprensible que por ende nos hace aclamar y aplaudir este espectacular filme de Villeneuve. Después de que 12 OVNIs aterrizan en distintos puntos de la tierra, la lingüista Louise Banks (Amy Adams) tiene en sus manos la labor de contactar con seres extraterrestres. El reto que esto significa es prácticamente inimaginable y imposible, pero el recorrido que emprende junto con Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) nos deja pensando profundamente acerca de lo que somos, de la manera en que hemos asimilado la comunicación humana de forma tan normal y cotidiana que nos cerramos a que existan formas impensables de realizarla, por ello se nos brinda una experiencia emocional cuya huella puede dejar a cualquiera impactado y pensando por un largo tiempo. La crítica que se hace al perfil del órgano militar del estadounidense es excelente, aunque los clichés de la historia romántica y de los roles de varios países y su forma de enfrentarse al caos se hacen presentes. Asimismo, el soundtrack pudo haber sido significativamente mejor. Aun así, esto no es suficiente para derribar tan impetuosa y satisfactoria obra de ciencia ficción. También abundan las excelentes imágenes y tomas de las que uno puede admirar los distintos ángulos, analizándose desde diferentes perspectivas, creando una obra donde cada uno de sus elementos se fusionan tan espectacularmente que mantiene la atención del espectador. Efectos grandiosos y ambiente deleitante se pone frente a nosotros, sumado a la más que sobresaliente actuación de Amy Adams son otros ejemplos del por qué ""Arrival"" merece nuestra atención, merece ser galardonada y ser vista muchas veces más. 92/100",Manolo P,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Feb 01, 2017",Manolo P,/user/id/958277467,RT,958277467,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001681692496/picture

5.0,"Another terrific movie.  I saw this when it was first released and decided to see it again tonight.  I'll say this again...Amy Adams is an underappreciated actress.  Consistently giving terrific performances. In this movie, she carries it.

"" Arrival delivers a must-see experience for fans of thinking person's sci-fi that anchors its heady themes with genuinely affecting emotion and a terrific performance from Amy Adams.""  That says it there.  There's no action...no weird alien encounters...just a thoughtful exploration of what an encounter would be like and why it might occur.

I found fascinating the breakdown of how to interpret a new language.  The circular nature of the story.  The question of would you change your future if you knew it.  I found it all entertaining and interesting.

I'm a fan of Amy Adams and disappointed that she didn't get an oscar nomination (I think she's had 5 so far).  The only other nominee I've seen this year is Emma Stone in La La Land.  She certainly deserved a nomination.  My guess is that the movie is too cerebral for voters or possibly they just don't like sci fi...which this is, but isn't.

5.0,"Between the mistifying production design, Jóhann Jóhannsson's blood-curdling score of intense strings and brass, and an overall cold atmosphere shot in a sort of monochromatic manner, Arrival is, in some ways, a horror movie. The way the film portrays an ""alien invasion"" as a sort of spontaneous event, something nobody could possibly prepare for and have no idea how to properly handle the situation, is very much terrifying, mostly because it so effortlessly captures just how true such a situation would be. And as we're thrust into the situation first-hand, led by the pairing of linguist Louise Banks and theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, the shrouded secrecy (which is quite literal in this case: the mysterious beings are hidden in a thick fog) only gets more chilling. Why are these beings here? Are they peaceful? Will they annihilate us in an instant with one single miscommunicated phrase? These tensions grow continuously during the film, as the military grows increasingly paranoid. At one point, an ultimately ambiguous phrase from the mysterious craft is received. Their first instinct: panic. Immediate interpretation of the message as a threat.

The film comes from Denis Villeneuve, who has continuously established himself as a master of building secrecy and tension, from intense crime thrillers Prisoners and Sicario to the mystifying and surreal Enemy. As a very cerebral, haunting film. Arrival certainly falls in line with those films, and yet also stands as perhaps Villeneuve's most emotionally involved film in his career. At its core, it's very much a film about humanity. Throughout the film, we're greeted with flashbacks to Louise's life pre-invasion, and the way Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer link the flashbacks to the current narrative is truly clever and genuinely heartfelt. In an age where this coukd be a cynical blockbuster where the aliens are instantly relegated to the ""bad guys"" for America to save the day from, it's nice to have a film that, for all of its horrific and unnerving aspects, is ultimately the exact opposite: a film about global teamwork and optimism and hope and, quite simply, life itself.",Andrew M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 31, 2017",Andrew M,/user/id/913749999,RT,913749999,

I'd like to say to this, it is not a blockbuster action flick, but a somber thought provoking movie, that elevates intelligent mystery over blockbuster action. Those who enjoy thought provoking themes and don't mind a distinct mood and feeling will enjoy this.
Much of the movie uses an atmosphere to set a tone, and that tone is consistent throughout the movie. Whereas movies like Interstellar portray visions of epicness and mastery of cinematography, Arrival suceeds in implementing a humanistic nature. It treats the viewer as intelligent, trusting the viewer to draw their own conclusions about the events of the film.

I'm not one for alien movies, but this is what an alien movie should be. It's smart, realistic, and grounded. It gets you wondering what an alien invasion would truly be like. How would we handle it? Would it bring the world together, or tear it apart? Villeneuve hits the nail on the head.
The visuals are near perfect, often jaw dropping. The score by Johann Johannsson is haunting, yet wonderful and sets each scene superbly.
The character development is complex, and Amy Adams puts on a performance of the year, if not decade. 
The ending is as satisfying as any ending I have ever seen. Beautiful, and possibly even tear jerking.
What I like best about the film is that it makes you feel something. It makes you think. It makes you appreciate the good in others, and that finding common ground with others can be ever-important in making the world go round.

4.0,"Arrival es la nueva película del aclamado director Denis Villeneuve (Conocido por películas tan interesantes como Enemy, Prisioners o Sicario) y pelea con grandes argumentos por alguno los puestos más altos en el género de la ciencia ficción.

Críticos como Roger Ebert han hablado mucho sobre el rumbo que están tomando las películas de terror con ejemplos como ""Babadook"" o ""It follows"", donde se rechaza el modelo del ""jumpscare"" (subidas de música e imágenes impactantes) por un estudio de personajes y el tratamiento de temas más profundos como la depresión o la angustia existencial. 

La cinta de Villeneuve así como Interestelar de Nolan o Prometheus de Ridley Scott son un ejemplo de este mismo modelo aplicado a la ciencia ficción. Arrival o La Llegada (como ha sido denominada en países de habla latina) es una película que rechaza el modelo de invasión alienígena de acción y decide realizar un estudio del personaje de Louise, una experta lingüista que obtiene la oportunidad de intentar mantener una conversación con los ""visitantes"". Y esto lo realiza dando respuesta a preguntas realmente interesantes como ¿De que modo nos enfrentamos a aquello que nos aterra?

Es difícil hablar de Arrival sin correr el riesgo de revelar parte de la trama pero si podemos definir aquello de lo que trata esta película es probablemente la comunicación. La cinta nos recuerda la importancia desmedida de esta capacidad y explota este hecho tan aparentemente sencillo de un modo realmente inteligente. ?
En el reparto encontramos probablemente uno de los puntos más destacables de la película junto al guión, y esto es sin duda la actuación de Amy Adams como Louise. Se trata de una actuación que esta recibiendo muchos rumores de Oscar a mejor actriz principal y no son infundados ya que de algún modo toda la película carga sobre los hombros de la actuación de Amy Adams y en lugar de flaquear consigue hacer, si cabe, aún más destacables algunos de los puntos más interesantes de Arrival. Sin embargo en el reparto también hay uno de los puntos más flacos de la película y se trata de la actuación de Jeremy Renner que aunque está principalmente correcto, logra que algunos de los momentos de más importancia de la película parezcan algo cursis y melodramáticos. Da la sensación de que Renner creía estar actuando en una película diferente y con menos aspiraciones.

La cinematografía de Villeneuve a manos Bradford Young es sin duda otro de los puntos absolutamente sobresalientes del largo y nos regala planos que quitan el aliento. Del mismo modo que utiliza planos cerrados aportando un sentimiento de opresión y tensión palpables, también utiliza planos amplios con mucho espacio para respirar y empaparse de la imagen en aquellos momentos donde nos revela información imprescindible. Juega muy bien con esta dicotomía que sin duda hace de esta película una pequeña y extraña joya.

En definitiva Arrival es una cinta ambiciosa que logra mantener muy bien su tono y sus aspiraciones, y nos cuenta esa historia que hemos oido tantas veces con una perspectiva nueva y fresca que no deja a nadie indiferente. Tiene algunos de los mejores momentos cinematográficos del año y probablemente la mejor actuación de la carrera de Amy Adams desde The Master. Villeneuve se está forjando un nombre en el panorama actual del cine comercial haciendo películas con tintes indies que le hacen uno de los directores más interesantes del momento.",Daniel G,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Jan 24, 2017",Daniel G,/user/id/971569969,RT,971569969,

3.0,"SPOILERS!!!
Arrival es un cinta de SCIFI Muy Fresca, Simple, Predecible y con buenos efectos.....Y si...Es mejor que Interstellar.

Es un día Normal en el Mundo cuando de repente aparecen Naves Espaciales en todo el mundo...pero no crean el caso, solo están ahí varadas sin hacer nada, es ahí cuando la CIA contrata 2 Expertos para poder Traducir a que vinieron estos Aliens.

Si buscas una Película al Estilo Independence Day no lo hallaras, La cinta no tiene Acción en Ningún Momento pero ni siquiera se ven las Caras de los Aliens y a un asi Funciona muy Bien por eso dije algo Fresco para este Genero...Solo hay Intriga y Tensión.

Y quizás sea el único pero su Plot Twist me pareció Predecible, porque ya veía venir que lo de la Hija era en el futuro y cuando llego el momento no me sorprendió en nada, Jeremy Renner llega a ser incluso de relleno y aveces hasta no hacer nada en la Cinta y es me dio Conflicto, Ademas de su Relación con Amy Adamas es Forzada.
La cinta gira en torno a Amy Admas de principio a fin.

Tenemos otro problema y es que la Película Funcionaria mejor si durara 1 Hora con 20 Minutos porque hay momentos muy de Relleno en los que no pasa absolutamente nada y llega a ser hasta cierto punto aburrida en especial sus Primeros 40 Minutos.

Eso si no le quita lo Interesante y la Tensión que te Transmite, Arrival es mi Película Menos Favorita para los Galardones pero su CGI es de lo mejor y aprecio que su trama sea simple y lineal.
No como Interstellar que todo es Forzado y trata de ser Complejo para llamar la Atención.

4.5,"2016's Arrival is a science fiction thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) and is based on the short story The Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang adapted by Eric Heisserer who wrote the screenplay.

Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, an expert in language and translation who is called upon when a number of alien vessels appear on Earth in various locations. The intentions of the aliens, who are attempting to communicate are not known and Banks is brought in by Colonel GT Weber (Forest Whitaker) to attempt to understand their language, and to understand what their plans are.

Alongside Banks as they begin to attempt to communicate with the aliens is Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist.

The film progresses with both their ongoing attempts to understand the aliens, but also against the backdrop of increasing tensions across the planet. These tensions are taking the form of looting and fuel / food shortages, but also the knowledge that other nations are attempting their own communications with the aliens (including Russia and China) and that these may lead to a different, more aggressive stance towards the visitors.

Amy Adams, who I remain of the view that she is incredibly underrated, delivers another standout performance, in her role through the film with essentially the whole narrative of the film resting on her performance. From the initial entrance into the craft, all the way through the efforts to communicate and interspersed cut away moments, she shines throughout the film.

The score (by Johan Johannsson)  too stands out with usage of what feels like aboriginal music in some parts and haunting orchestral score (which in part uses Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' at other moments through the film.

Villeneuve direction of this matches the quality of his previous work, which when you look at the work he's delivered, is a significant achievement. Tension builds throughout the scenes (especially those on the alien craft) and he has woven a film together that is thought provoking, moving, and really really smart.

That, ultimately is one of the main achievements of the film, it doesn't dumb down its content and delivers a very clever film that manages to keep getting better throughout. In the recent series of smart science fiction that Christopher Nolan has been a large part of with Inception and Interstellar, it really stands out as an achievement.

I'd really encourage anyone that hasn't seen it to make the effort. It is easily one of the very best films of 2016.

4.5,"Arrival is a new film directed by Denis Villeneuve, one of the best directors working currently, in my opinion. The story follows a linguist, Louise (played by Amy Adams), and a scientist, Ian (played by Jeremy Renner), who are hired by the army to decipher the language of the aliens that have landed on Earth in their spaceships. I'd hate to spoil anything about the plot and how it all comes to a close, but I'll have to spoil certain things, so I'm putting a spoiler warning here! With that said, this is a brilliant movie, really. From the very beginning it draws you in and it's consistently intriguing throughout. It never becomes dull, too long or even pretentious. It is a slow burn movie, but the story concerning the aliens is fantastic and the ending payoff is highly satisfying and made me think more about what I saw earlier. The aliens are very well designed and their language is the big mystery of this movie. Following Louise and Ian learning their language and teaching the aliens English was very entertaining. I had a lot of fun watching them teaching each other. It felt so much different from any other alien invasion movie I've ever seen. This isn't the kind of an alien invasion movie where the aliens are just attacking and trying to destroy the world, there isn't any action in this movie. It consists the most of conversations with the aliens, deciphering their language, learning their past and it feels much more interesting than just another big blockbuster with aliens. The cinematography is breathtaking. Especially the first time we see the alien spaceship, it felt reminiscent of the scene when we first see humans interacting with the Monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie is visually stunning all throughout its runtime, as is every Villeneuve movie. The soundtrack by Jóhann Jóhannsson is sublime. His score is one of the best of the year [2016] and I'm still re-listening to it as I'm writing this review. Beautiful. The characters are very well developed, especially Amy Adams' character. Ian isn't as developed, we don't know anything about his life except that he's a scientist, but his character serves more as an element to Louise's development and when you look at it that way, he served his purpose. Forest Whitaker is also good in this movie, though not a very interesting character. There's not much to say about him. The star here is definitely Amy Adams and her character. Amy Adams delivers an incredible performance and when certain things are revealed about her character, it makes her even more interesting. The ending was powerfully emotional. I'm not going to say what it is, but I will say it's one of the best twist endings I've ever seen. The thing I didn't like about this movie is just one scene. That's it.

This is sci-fi with a Master's degree that doesn't falter on Hollywood razzle-dazzle; there's an A-list cast; there's scale and bluster; there's special effects that wow; there's pace and tension; there was even a grand IMAX release, should you be so inclined. But it is also an intensely cerebral piece of work, transforming Ted Chiang's short story about a linguist who is called in to communicate with extra-terrestrials after 12 space vessels that ominously land in various locations around the world, into an atmospheric wrong-footing puzzle which plays with narrative conventions and linguistic head-scratchers.

Flat, blank, characterless, with nothing of any real genuine intrigue or purpose. Another example of 'nothingness' masquerading as supposed 'art'. The plot-holes are in their masses, but that's not the issue here - the ""film"", plainly, is just boring, pointless, vapid; to unbearable levels; and on all fronts (the look on Forrest Whittaker's face throughout says it all). None of the characters have any depth, all more cardboard than actual cardboard would permit, and everything is narrated with no soul or verve; unintentionally lifeless; dire. There is no feeling or emotional-engagement - whatsoever. And the film, based on a short-story (which painfully shows), desperately yearns to be dark, meaningful, existential - but there is simply no substance to any of it. You obtain nothing. Gain nothing. Just nonsense. The art of storytelling, gone amiss. And to add insult-to-injury, the underlining ""message"" (if one can call it that) at the end is so naff and inconsequential, that you wonder if a computer or a robot has produced and made the film, thinking it were 'avant-garde'. There is no payoff. Don't bother. Or if you dare to test its (unendurable) shallow waters, on its imminent release, make sure you've plenty of work around the house to do.

4.5,"Arrival revolves around a linguist named Louise, played by Amy Adams, who is recruited to assist in confronting an alien species that has landed on Earth. 12 UFOs appear randomly around the world, but humans are finding it difficult to communicate with the aliens in order to find out what they want. Louise, paired with a mathematician named Ian, played by Jeremy Renner, sets out to find a way to talk with the aliens.
Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the most exciting directors working today. Prisoners is chilling and Sicario is a masterpiece. Both movies go far beyond their generic genres. Prisoners goes beyond most suspenseful thrillers by studying how its protagonists deal with grief, loss, and uncertainty. Sicario goes beyond cartel action dramas by studying humanity pushed to the brink, beyond boundaries and comfortability.
Arrival carries that tradition by going beyond general science fiction action films. But it also defects from Villeneuve's previous films' focus on revenge by taking on more optimistic motivations, though they're not immediately obvious.
Every behind the camera aspect of this movie is spectacular. Villeneuve's direction combined with Bradford Young's cinematography create a chilling, somewhat somber world that's beautiful to look at. And it's all set to a moving score by composer Johann Johansson, that builds alongside the movie in it's scale and emotionalism.
Even the aspects of the movie I was already expecting moved me. I thought the alien ship reveal wouldn't be powerful since it's presence is the basis of the movie's advertising. It takes up most of every poster and commercial, but it's reveal is built up in a way that it's still incredible to see. Exploring the ship and seeing the aliens themselves is even more astounding. It's a completely new and fresh feeling that most movies don't give you.
The story itself blossoms throughout the movie into many different directions, each one extremely interesting. There's the response of the public, who are uncertain and afraid of the aliens. There's the response of other countries, who are interpreting the alien language on their own, sometimes in unfortunate ways. The combination of the fearful public and aggressive militaries put pressure on the US military to get an understanding of the aliens and why they're here before war breaks out. But there's also the story of Louise herself. We explore her past, her experiences with the aliens, the importance of her being there, and the importance of conversation. But it handles it's diverse plot incredibly well. It's as political as it is philosophical. It's massive and at the same time intimate. This is the kind of movie Interstellar was desperately trying to be, but ultimately fell short.
Amy Adams is devastatingly powerful as Louise. It's a very strong lead performance, possibly the best of her career. She carries this movie and gives us a character we can heavily empathize with. She's smart, strong, and brave. By the midway point we fully believe she can be the hero the movie needs, for the world and for herself.
Jeremy Renner starts off as an alright main supporting character, first getting worse, then getting considerably better. At one point he has this cockiness, this forced fun guy attitude that should be now referred to as the ""Chris Pratt trope"". The lovable bad-ass. A fun character but one who's definitely starting to wear his welcome. But he fleshes out a bit, and we see him start to relate more with Adam's character and become more relatable himself. That being said, his character isn't super useful in terms of story progression. Adams gets most of the job done by herself, and while Renner plays off her well, I feel the movie would've played alright with Adams as the lone protagonist.
This movie has a few more imperfections. When Louise is recruited by the military, it's explained that she worked with them before, but how she was recruited for that previous mission isn't explained. And because of that, it's not immediately believable that she is this genius linguist, it feels more like she was picked at random. It was just kind of confusing. Also, the explanation of why the aliens are here wasn't ideal. I mean, it's not bad, and it's different from what I was expecting, but it's reveal was just kind of ""oh"". Also Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlberg are great in the movie, but are a bit underutilized. Though I understand to have more of them would mean to take away from the development of Adam's character, so it's not terrible, but I like those actors so I like when they have more to work with.
The one thing that I thought would bother me but somehow didn't is how it is basically Exposition: The Movie. We are forced to learn everything through character dialogue. And most movies don't know how to do it properly, and are very boring because of it. But like a page out of the David Fincher handbook, dialogue scenes are exciting, riddled with tension and importance. We pay attention because we want to, not because we have to. I mean, we have to, but the wanting to is a nice caveat.
But there is an event or revelation in the movie, an unexpected turning point, and I gotta say, it kinda blew my mind, and helped me get over whatever issues preceded it. It was a complete surprise and took the story to a new level of greatness. I won't spoil what that is, but I will say don't arrive (no pun intended) to this movie late. Every scene matters and honestly might need re-watching to be fully understood. And maybe that revelation might not be super impressive to you, or maybe you'll hate it for being a departure from the straight-forwardness the movie had built until then, but it can't be argued that it's something different, something we don't get very often in film, and I feel like that deserves to be cherished.
Arrival is held together by its dedication to communication and discovery, introducing us to something new at a gradual pace and that keeps us invested and excited. It's thought provoking, and we are motivated to learn alongside Louise.

3.5,First off I consider myself a huge film enthusiasts pretty much you name it I've seen it. In my personal opinion I think this film is one of the biggest pieces of false advertisement I've seen since suicide squad.

2.5,"Poor editing and rearrangement, the future memory at the beginning is so confusing. I keep asking the same question while watching: How many daughters indeed she had??? How many alive and how many dead???
Seems like the aliens already have 'Human' in their vocabulary. If aliens were really back from 3000 years in the future, why aliens didn't prepare something like ""Human Language Dictionary""? 
I still don't understand whats the non-zero sum up in this movie. I don't see what human wins? Union? No haze (yeah the aliens live in haze so they may control haze as well)? There's no further elaboration. If it's technology, at least say something. If it's just that language, I don't think thats benefiting human anyway. Some may say this language is associated with non-linear timing system, so as long as you control this alien language, you can open time anyway you like. This will be the gift for human. However, in the fact that, in the future, Louise actually told Ian her ability of seeing future, and Ian left her for the reason she had seen their daughter's death. From this we can see that the ability of controlling time doesn't come along with the language. Ok even if it does. An ability that makes anyone can easily change the future and past, i don't really see it as a gift.
Another annoying problem is that, who, Louise from the future or Louise in the past, knows General Shang's number and words? Which comes first??? It's obviously a logical question. But the way the story line is pushed seems really weird by asking this question.
The whole movie was filmed in basically only three scenes: One terraced house with several rooms for different scenes; One grass land scene; and one in school.
Also the BGM really got me annoyed. Probably the director should watch more asian horror and ghost films to see how they control the nerves.

4.0,"A deeper and more mysterious sci-fi drama about humanity itself. Not the arrivers.

The marketing of 'Arrival' was greatly focused om ""them"". But the film takes multiple different steps inwards. It's all about the human perspective and their reactions to the unknown. Humanity is the main character here, not the aliens. It takes time to understand the story, and for some of you; a rewatch might be a good thing, since it's not a pure linear film. It's a slow moving drama that got much to tell about the basics of humanity & morality. If that isn't a thing for you, then pick a different film. Amy Adams as Louise Banks is the major player, and this might be her best performance to date. Natural chemistry and over the top mother-daughter depth is a wow! Character inside might be a lacking aspect in the first act, but the film is heavily focused on build-up, and most of the inside doesn't arrive until in the final act. The character inside develops greatly throughout the film, it follows the non-linear storytelling. Sure even more inside to side-characters would've been great, but the focus lies greatly on Louise Banks for sure and we get a lot of inside to her! But we don't really get that much to Ian Donnelly for example. 

'Arrival' got a clear structure and a stunning build-up. The film takes one step at a time and generally never felt rushed nor uneventful. Sure one rushed moment did exist on a personal level, surrounding the understanding of the aliens. I felt that the editors missed an important plot-point. Another nit-picky aspect can be the uneven pacing at several places throughout the film. But it's not a flawed film. No way. The third act is a major part of the structure. It's where the basic plot and characters blend together into a higher purpose. Some aspects of it did however come off as a bit flat -- the film showed several inventive moves, but some lesser ones did appear in the ending. Once the basic plot was revealed; there wasn't that much more to be excited by. The film fights hard ethical and inventive questions, but it does on the other hand have several a bit too simple moments. It's pretty much the same with the expositions -- who the writers integrated very well into this flick, but they were a bit too noticeable throughout the story. 

'Arrival' is a huge groundbreaker among other sci-fi films of 2016. It's one of those slow-burners with classical sci-fi elements like time, morality, culture, religion, humanity, who we really are, and what is the nature of humanity really? Who's the real antagonist; them or us? 'Arrival' might take inspiration of previous sci-fi works, but it's one of a kind -- and let's not forget the stunning direction from Denis Villeneuve. Just the visuals alone might bring an Oscar to this stunning sci-fi flick.

4.0,"Despite the fact that this movie has aliens in it, please, for the love of what's good, don't expect the movie to be an action-packed alien invasion movie. It is NOT that kind of movie. Arrival is a slow-paced mystery drama that touches on the less hostile side of things when it comes to first contact. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker primarily. Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, an accomplished language expert recruited by the government in an attempt to decipher or communicate with the extraterrestrials on their intention of coming to Earth.
Overall, I would suggest the movie to people who enjoy themselves a little bit of mystery or just simply wanting a refreshing take on the stereotypical alien invasion storyline, which really pays off in droves.

4.0,"I remember reading Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life"" way back when and being completely blown away. It's one of the very best short stories I've ever come across, infinitely memorable and perfectly structured, every sentence in the correct place. It's also one of those pieces of fiction that is markedly not cinematic, something easily described as unfilmable. Yet French Canadian art house auteur Denis Villeneuve has done just that in the form of ""Arrival"".

Ted Chiang's story is about a linguist who is given the ultimate dream job of communicating with the first alien visitors to Earth. It's an absolutely enticing depiction of a wonderfully detailed process where a language completely alien reveals its nature. As a reader who doesn't understand linguistics at all, I found this all insanely addictive. We also get memory flashes about the linguist's relationship with her daughter, merging the personal with the scientifically intriguing into a whole that's as stimulating as it's touching. The very structure of the story brings with it mind-bending speculations involving philosophy, ethics and reality itself through peculiar points of view that play freely with temporal mechanics.

Reportedly the film project started with screenwriter Eric Heisserer who decided to take on the impossible task of adapting Chiang's ingenious creation. The resulting script seems to me exactly what you would expect a Hollywood adaptation of a brilliant, endlessly intriguing and smart story to be: dramatic, but formulaic and hideously simplified. The linguistic thrill ride has been reduced to tidbits of technobabble and montage scenes. Only the feel of a challenging process has been retained with little of the actual process remaining. All those lovely, poignantly funny scenes of parenthood tracking the maternal experience from a child's birth to adulthood have been turned into dreamlike flashes of the ideal, portraying the daughter mostly in early childhood, mostly angelic. The short story's main premise that allowed for the most ambitious and brilliant ideas on perception has been given the role of a mere twist near the end.

What Heisserer adds is the dramatic ticking clock. In the film, all of 12 alien objects land all over the globe, creating an immediate diplomatic crisis. This leads to a horribly clichéd but depressingly plausible conflict between scientists and government, aka the impatient military, as well. The most depressing thing about the script is that when Heisserer pitched it for the major studios, they still found it too smart and wanted him to dumb down the science even further. Some studio also requested that the protagonist was changed into a man. No wonder Hollywood is in a crisis. ""Arrival"" got made as an independent feature and was a big hit.

If you look at the script alone, ""Arrival"" seems competent but pretty standard, even forgettable Hollywood fair that doesn't do justice to its source material. Fortunately, the project was taken on by Denis Villeneuve. I remember blown away by the director in 2010 when I saw his completely masterful political Middle East thriller ""Incendies"". The director came to be known for emotionally devastating and addictively complex stories directed with particular aesthetic eye. His move to the U.S. and English films spelled a reduction in complexity, but his ability to visualize psychological experience remains top notch.

In Villeneuve's hands the ""necessary evil"" of the plot's political ticking clock becomes effective. In the story the scientists' work was more realistic as it took months and was unhurried. But in the film the urgency actually lends its own sense of authenticity. Villeneuve gives his stars- Amy Adams in the lead as linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner as sidekick mathematician Ian Donnelly- an opportunity to portray insecurity and fatigue with devotion. The whole feel of ""Arrival"" is hazy, sleep deprived and uncertain, in one word alien. It's at its very best during a couple of sparsely distributed dream sequences that would feel like simple nightmares if not for their genuinely otherworldly, peculiar atmosphere. Close-ups of the involved actors' exhausted faces ground everything, makes what's going on relatable. Even those clichéd flashes of Louse's motherhood fit the aesthetic web of ""Arrival"".

Cinematic storytelling isn't as resonant with us as the linguistic storytelling of literature, which often makes movie adaptations seem as explanatory in relation to their source text. What is alluded to in text and left for the reader to interpret themselves, has often been underscored and written open in an adapted screenplay. It occurred to me that- if you abandon the dull linearity of time- Chiang's superior short story ""Story of Your Life"" operates perfectly as a really good interpretation of ""Arrival"" the movie. It probably works really well to see the movie first and then read the deeper, analytical short story on top of that.

As a lover of science fiction I'm often frustrated with how the genre is handled by the movie industry which embraces the visual possibilities of speculative settings but rarely has the courage to utilize the endless narrative and especially thematic potential inherent in them. ""Arrival"" tries and mostly succeeds in this, maybe not in the most ambitious manner, but still. It's good, very well acted drama that feels realistic yet mystical. It has great intensity and aims to challenge the viewer, which is always something to be thankful for.",Mikael K,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Jan 12, 2017",Mikael K,/user/id/822954353,RT,822954353,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1099868060/picture

5.0,"A rare type of Spielberg-Nolan style science-fiction drama full of metaphors that is steep in its specific themes told in a sense of realism. The film is an unusual discovery, it starts emotionally, moves in a deliberate pacing, slowly builds up a puzzle of complex paradox and ends up stunningly impactful, amplifying the questions of existential dilemma. It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception.

5.0,"One moment is all it takes to change our lives, to define a species. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Enemy, Prisoners) presents this moment with a profound silence uncharacteristic of science fiction. No great battle, no chaos or destruction, just the arrival. Sometimes the most terrifying action is nothing at all.

The film opens to Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a distinguished linguist traveling to work as a lecturer at the University of Montana. All around her people scramble to see screens displaying news although Banks continues to her lecture hall unaware. Almost immediately after beginning the lecture a phone goes off, then another. The world has just changed, the scale of the change however, is hidden for a few more seconds.

After tentively switching a news channel on, they learn of a mysterious object in rural Montana, massive in size and visible for miles around floating just metres from the ground. Speculation suggests an experimental military ship until more objects are found across the world, 12 in total. Villeneuve plants the audience into his world, desperate for any sliver of information but before any possible understanding can form an alarm rings around the lecture hall. The whole state is on lockdown while governments across the world scramble to figure out what is going on. As Banks enters the parking lot we see people rushing to get back to family and jets flying overhead, in a deafening array of sound. 

The next day by contrast is eerily quiet, Banks travels to work as usual although it soon becomes apparent that she's the only one. Here she is approached by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) to join a military task force at the landing site. Working alongside a theoretical physicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), they must not only establish the methods of communication with the unknown visitors, but decipher it and be able to communicate back. Some nations faced with a landing do not have peace as the primary objective on their agenda. China and Russia mobilise their respective armies to defend the populous from an expected invasion and it becomes a race against time to avert war with potentially peaceful extraterrestrials. Chaos is a persistent threat illustrated through widespread rioting and looting by people under the impression that the end of times is upon them.

Every few hours Banks and Donnelly travel to the bottom of the spaceship from a makeshift base nearby. Cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma, A Most Violent Year) achieves an almost tangible level of anticipation as the sheer scale of the pebble shaped ship is slowly revealed to us. This feeling is very shortly dwarfed in the sequence following as the team make their way inside. For all the advanced technology of both alien and human design depicted, there was a certain irony in using a scissor lift to bridge the gap between the 2 civilisations. When the aliens are eventually revealed, dubbed heptopods for their 7 legs, Banks is unable to make sense of their whale like cries. With the relations of world nations seeming to crumble around them, failure is not an option and upon seeing words and sentences in a visual form and not noise, a deeply complex and beautiful written language is revealed. The further she plunges into this language, the more her reality begins to shift and in doing so changes the fate of her world.

The climax of Arrival is both staggering and satisfying as several confusing elements from early on suddenly become crystal clear. With fabulous cinematography accompanied by a soul-stirring score by Jóhann Jóhannsson, this is truly a first contact film like no other. Villeneuve delivers a poignant message underlining the utter necessity of communication that transcends the screen and resonates beyond.",James G,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Jan 06, 2017",James G,/user/id/857767897,RT,857767897,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1487614064/picture

4.5,"Everyday society is wondering when the aliens will come, it's an idea reflected in short stories, novels and movies. Just the fact of receving the visit of people from other space constitute a scientific breakthrough. The implications of communication, etiquette and approach goes down to a single question: are you come in peace?

Several directors have portray aliens like friendly, mysterious or a real threat to humanity. James Cameron ""The Abyss"", Steven Spielberg ""Close Encounter of The Third Kind"" Robert Zemeckis ""Contact"" are to me the most influential movies of Dennis Villeneuve ""Arrival""

Linguistic Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is been introduced in the movie as a mother and wife, she holds her baby, when she start talking, walking and becomes a teenager, until she passed away. She seems to be alone, even visually. Perhaps as a linguistic she knows how the world communicate, but she is unable to communicate emotionally with her love ones. During the emotional scene you can hear her voice over ""But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrive..."" Her nihilistic words are the vehicle to the arrival of a large group of extra terrestrial. 

12 spaceships appear across the planet (China, Greenland, Siberia and Black Sea in Russia, Japan, United States, Sudan, Venezuela, Sierra Leone, Wales, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean. All the government of these countries are looking for answers. So they decided to bring specialists in several areas to obtain information about the aliens as well their intentions. Jeremy Renner plays physics professor who also works with Louise to find ways to communicate with the aliens.

Villeneuve develops an impressive environment, where atmospheric sounds are very important for the movie. The story encapsulate Louise character, close ups where she is with her daughter and open spaces when she is alone, in fact when she is in a group her position is always ahead differentiate herself from the rest. To me Louise connects perfectly with Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) in Gravity a smart professional who is grieving the lost of a love one, in the middle of a situation require her to develop a new set of skills and abilities to reach a goal. 

The political tone of ""Arrival"" express how divided are nations in peril, but also able to work together when you take risk on your own. Governments set rules that meant to be broken just to make things right. Like in the The Abyss the government secret agenda presents them as the real enemy, not the aliens, which for the audience are friends.

One of those movies with too many confusing 'flashbacks', and then 'flash forwards'.  
Somehow flashing back to teaching her very young daughter (who has grown to teenage before dying of some disease) how to read and communicate is a key to doing same with the aliens.
Oh, and the aliens are like giant squid, or octopuses (pi?), with tentacle arms and starfish-like hands.
And as so often, they are 'misunderstood aliens', who apparently have come in peace.
And they don't communicate well, cuz they say 'weapon' when they mean gift.  And this confuses the armies, that want to destroy them.
  And they know the future, and we are to realize that time is not linear, but cyclical.  That aspect of Eastern religions has served humanity so well.
Perhaps 'cerebral', but Some would say it was 'slow'.
And 'dark'.  Many of the scenes were inexplicably too dark (why do so many moves do that?)   The postscript doc said it was purposely 'monochromatic', with very little color.
Oh, and stay til the end, after the credits, for the promised short 'documentary' style interviews with actors and directors, all praising each other and the film.

4.5,"'Arrival' is the Sci-Fi movie that we have all been waiting for; it doesn't follow similar story lines that is typical of most alien films, whereby the plot simply comprises of aliens descending on Earth, find out that humans are dangerous and destructive to themselves and them, thus causing all out war - we have seen this time and time again, but 'Arrival' really sets the bar high in modern times for the genre.

This movie straight from the beginning shows off beautiful visuals and cinematography, courtesy of the bright cinematographer 'Bradford Young', which really resonates with the unique plot this film has to offer.

English and Science are the two subjects that are significantly key to the plot of this film, giving a sense of realism as to what we do as the human race to understand ourselves from a language perspective and our place in the galaxy and the universe, as well as our voyage for other intelligent life and how they might communicate.

'Arrival' will keep you guessing and mentally put you on the edge of your seat. You will be analytically questioning everything that is happening in order to make sense of what is occurring as the film unfolds. Things may seem confusing, but ultimately become more clear towards the the final act of the film.

5.0,"We are the future we create. This is what Arrival is about: The critical role that foresight plays in harnessing our fears and arriving at those critical decisions which create our future. The film's characters replay this theme over and over as they revisit choices to provide a short life of freedom or a prolonged life of critical illness care, decisions to go to war or not, to be with another or not, and even the approach for alien first contact.  Each choice is portrayed in a certain 'fog' (seen as news blackouts, Louise's confusion, and even Aliens in fog) that represents the lack of clarity we all have in the present of what the right thing is for the future. The aliens' purpose simply was to fulfill the plot's main point by observing that our only 'weapon' (which Louise points out to be a tool) to move past this is to more consciously place ourselves in the flow of time - to truly understand the choices that lie before us and have the foresight to make decisions wisely for the outcomes we seek. As the aliens (real or imagined) stated, 'the gift' they were giving ('the weapon that opens time') that helps us today will help everyone in the future. The ending shows that the real battle with time is in our minds and how we arrive to take control of it.

5.0,"Arrival is a very interesting movie that plays on a few themes. Honestly I don't want to ruin it for you, but if you're looking for an alien action movie, please look elsewhere. 

Arrival is a thoughtful Sci-Fi; more deep and pensive. It peaks your curiosity in a gentle, as well as stressful way. You follow the main character and are sometimes swept away in her memories as she goes through a trying period of time; trying to make sense of the hovering spaceships dotted around the world.

A more human approach to Sci Fi than is typically portrayed. Very enjoyable. Highly recommend. A good movie if you don't want something too hectic, but interesting enough to keep you going.",Confabulate A,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 29, 2016",Confabulate A,/user/id/975903242,RT,975903242,

3.5,"Like some of the genre's best, Arrival's strength is in framing an effective science fiction story around a seemingly-unrelated topic and intertwining the two until they become inseparable. In this case, we deal with the fabric of linguistics - the desperate search for a communicative first step - and how even something so dry and cerebral can make for great theatrical drama. Amy Adams is quietly empathic in the central role, a frazzled interpreter with a strong sense of personal loss who pours herself into the work. Against the backdrop of your typical plastic-sheeted, pop-up government research facility, she's our human connection to a very clinical, inhuman situation. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are around, and give their roles an earnest effort, but they're too cookie-cutter and predictable to amount to much. As is much of the third act, unfortunately, when we discard the delicate analysis of words (both spoken and written) and give in to more bombastic, military-driven temptations. At its core, the film really has one great revelation, and while that's effective at first, it's then rehashed and hammered until its sharp edges grow dull. I still see a lot of promise here, and while it's in the groove it makes for an authentically strange, different viewing experience. The work of Arrival's sound design team plays a big part in that, and will surely be recognized when awards season rolls around. The plot's blunt, heavy-handed climax, though, can be a bitter pill to swallow.",Sean L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Dec 29, 2016",Sean L,/user/id/793676809,RT,793676809,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/627296696/picture

4.5,"'Arrival' initially introduces itself as a sci-fi thriller, it does give us just that, but with an excess of emotion and drama-thanks to a narrative that is 
supplemented by its genre that probes certain questions about humanity. 

Starring Amy Adams as expert linguist Louise Banks, leading a team to investigate a mysterious spacecraft. Their investigation is accompanied by political chaos and panic which leads Earth on the verge of global war, forcing Banks and her team on a race to find answers.

Cinema has considered a wide range of depictions when it comes to extraterrestrial visitors, and we are familiar with the good-hearted kind (familiar with E.T.?) and the aliens-on-an-annihilation-wave kind ('War of the Worlds,' 'Independence Day'). 'Arrival' definitely improves what audiences can expect out of a sci-fi film, and it doesn't settle for the exciting thrills of a blockbuster. 

'Arrival' has a lot going on on its mind, honestly speaking, this film isn't about the aliens. 'Arrival' is ultimately a human drama told under the guise of a sci-fi flick. And that despite using the generic sci-fi premise- What are the intentions of the aliens? With certain tweaks and circumstances (as sci-fi films tend to do) it doesn't finish in the generic fashion you expect because it delivers an emotionally satisfying narrative, thanks to Amy Adams. That's what makes 'Arrival' special and unforgettable.  

Overall, another solid outing from Dennis Villeneuve's direction and Amy Adam's performance helps sell the film that's already incredibly executed and ambitious in concept.",Kyle V,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 29, 2016",Kyle V,/user/id/927916606,RT,927916606,

The landing of the aliens worked as an inciting incident, but I never understood the controling idea, that is what the story was attempting to convey.  The statement by the aliens, ""We are here to help humanity ended up begging the question, help with what?  Help how?  Those questions were never answered.  The controling idea could have been the future-seeing-ability of the main character leads to first contact.  But, that idea never was developed and led to nothing more than, ""do you want to have a baby.""  Beyond the fundamental story flaws I felt no emotional connection whatsoever with the main character despite obvious attempts by the screenwriter and director to create the emotional connnection.  The clay figures and child drawings could have been an effective tool in conveying the message of the film, but the director chose to simply point the camera at them to I suppose create mystery but in my opinion only succeeded in creating vagueness.  In the end there was nothing that connected all the vague symbols in a way that was really engaging.  I did like the fact that for once a Scifi film did not protray the so-called aliens as malevolent creatures come to destroy humanity.

3.0,"Lets starts honest

I really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore.

With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn't. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed.

Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can't help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped.

The Story

Twelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner.

All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about 'their' pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate.

Here is where it went wrong

In between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn't have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn't follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up.

Say what?

This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry.

Final thoughts

I suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp of a global catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other?

Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path?

4.5,"Well damn.

I couldn't stop thinking about this one and may not for awhile. ""Arrival"" is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've seen in this year. Everything about this film was just top notch that I can't put into words without going all over.

So let put it like this:

Amy Adams was wonderful in this. A very grounded and real performance. Probably her best. Same thing that can said about Jeremy Renner.

And how the aliens were part of the story was fascinating and quite clever. Without spoiling anything, they had a unique look to them. Like spiders. Although out the film, you feel their presence. A presence that's both scary and yet remarkable.

Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. He can release a movie every year and still be close of making a masterpiece. Villeneuve delivers a haunting and heartbreaking story that leaves the audience with a experience that will stay with them. A beautiful, thought-provoking, Sci-Fi film that isn't an action or war movie. And I'm even more excited to see ""Blade Runner 2049"".

Impressive, exquisite this movie comes in Christmas time to offer us a lesson of humbleness, understanding, patience, acceptance, to wish to the whole universe peace and good will.
I watched this movie as a linguistic metaphor of the non-verbal communication between beans, humans or not. The whole story is revolving around the deep roots of languages and communication, mistakes that are made because of misunderstandings.
Psychologists agree that the sound people love to hear the most is their name. Everyone has a name and everyone matters. The main idea of this movie could be, in my humble opinion, that science, art, math and physics, creativity, expressiveness, philosophy, religion, all are rooted ""in the word"" and work together to create a better understanding of words, of their connotations, literal calque, etymology.
The story of the sailors who met the aborigines and asked them, ""what were the things that jumped around and carried babies in pouches?"" The aborigines said ""kangaroo.""
Later the sailors found out that ""kangaroo"" meant ""I don't know"". Well, this made up story proved the point of Dr. Banks ( Amy Adams): miscommunication.
Louise, having the ""weapon"" to see the future, is able and chosen to receive ""the gift"" of the alien language.
""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"", asks Louise, accepting her own cross to carry.
Talking about languages and understanding, this movie offers interesting and true points:
""Language is the foundation of civilization.... The first weapon drawn in a war"".
""If all I ever gave you is a hammer...Everything's a nail.""
""You can understand communication and still end up single"".
""Memory is a strange thing. We are bound by time. By its order.
Well, the list can continue. The whole movie is built around the little test of dr. Banks.
Colonel Weber, refused by Louise in the beginning to work with him, is going to Berkeley to get Louise's competitor. ""Ask him the Sanskrit word for 'war,' and its translation,"" Louise tells. Apparently, the Berkeley linguist said ""gavisti"" means ""an argument"". Louise replies:""it means a desire for more cattle"".

5.0,"This is not your typical humanity unites to fight the coming alien invasion movie. Matter of fact, it's not like any ""aliens come to Earth"" movie you've likely seen on the big screen in the past dozen years. It's beautiful with a haunting score (that I'm totally buying). It's a thinking, feeling sci-fi flick with a unique subtle edge. I enjoyed this move immensely and recommend it as a break from the standard sci-fi fare.

This movie isn't bogged down in outpourings of unintelligible scientific theory through dialogue. The science is a given; the explanations inescapably plain language. No one is arguing that science isn't the way or questioning scientific truths considering the alien arrival. In fact, if you're not careful, you might miss how very rooted in scientific theory this movie is. The science is the foundation on which the work of the movie happens. Once conversation between Donnelly and a fellow mathematics expert casually reveals alien recognition of our mathematical concepts. This elite team works together facing what could be the crisis to end all crisis and science and language are the tools necessary to guide us through with any chance at survival. It's a moment for hard science and social science fans to get a wee bit giddy; while keeping the movie accessible to everyone.

Arrival begins with a voice (Amy Adams) speaking of beginnings and endings. We watch as she talks of joy and (re)lives a horrible and deeply painful tragedy. The movie segues smoothly to present day Dr. Banks at work on campus the day ""they"" arrive. The look and feel of the scenes are vivid, almost entrancing.

Linguistics professor Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) leads an elite team of investigators when gigantic vessels enter Earth's atmosphere and hover over 12 locations around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and team race the clock to find a path to communicate with the extraterrestrials. Banks takes a chance on behalf of all humanity and her choice will either save mankind or plunge the world into war.

The cinematography gives everything an ethereal feel to everything pulling you in to each moment as though you're truly one of the crowd watching stunned as events unfold. Dr. Banks' is disturbingly calm when a military Colonel (Forest Whitaker) approaches her requesting a translation of a ""recording."" Until this moment, Dr. Banks' seems soft, pliable. When pushed to draw conclusions about what she's heard without being given answers to questions she believed vital - but the Colonel sees as attempts to manipulate him into taking her to the arrival site - to making a useful assessment; Dr. Banks stands her ground. She erupts from her numbness to throw out a challenge at the Colonel's back as he exits her office. It's your first hint that mayhap there's more to Dr. Banks than appearance leads one to believe. Her introduction to the team, and to Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) happens on a midnight ride through the sky. An over-reaching theme of the movie is deftly if simply introduced: Banks' life's work places language at the basis of everything; the first weapon in war whereas Donnelly scoffs claiming the entire premise to be wrongheaded and posits that in fact science is in fact what anchors us to bedrock.

Everything unfolds at a steady but inexorable pace with an increasing sense of urgency with every discovery, or set back. The director, Denis Villeneuve, lures the audience further with glimpses of Banks' memories that seem to confuse just as much as the assist Dr. Banks in her work all against a backdrop of frantic populations and paranoid world leaders demanding to know what ""they"" want. It adds a layer to the story drawing attention to not only Dr. Banks' role as translator but as a bridge between science and the senses. Her fate begins to feel as vital as the outcome of her task as alien communicator. Arrival is at its bedrock a movie about communication and commonality. It's about language and meaning. It's collaboration and cooperation. It's about setting aside fear and human hubris of trying to interpret the actions of an alien species through the lens of our motivations and history.

The movie deviates from the source material (I suggest you pick up a copy of Stories of Your Life) but only in ways that allow for good storytelling and more opportunity to explore questions about the nature of choice. The casting and acting are equally great. Although there are moments where the disconnect between Dr. Banks and Dr. Connelly from the rest of the crew is a bit too obvious. There are moments when you wish for more perspectives beyond Banks' lens particularly as you begin to realize she might just be an unreliable and inconsistent narrator. But Villeneuve makes sharp choices drawing on the identifiable elements from the current societal climate for punches of realistic hysteria playing out in the streets and glimpses of the vitriolic rhetoric pushing for a ""show of force"" by radio personalities and news media. He creates an environment where the inevitable breakdown between mission and mankind drives home the point that we are sometimes our own worst enemy.",Ro M,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 21, 2016",Ro M,/user/id/975860225,RT,975860225,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1185742321481175/picture

4.0,"In my review for last year's ""The Martian"", I'd mentioned that there's been a sci-fi trend of annually-attempted successful narratives that gone out of this world in one's journey. The line ""out of this world"" states the limitless boundary of the sci-fi genre with wondrous, yet fictitious predictions what could be possible, then it gets tested by scientific accuracy to estimate the so-called length. Although, that applies to sci-fi flicks that aren't ridiculously improbable by flawed execution - referring to the ""Independence Day"" overblown sequel as an example. As we were in the final quarter of the movie year that's known as the awards season - and time of the main contenders, the sci-fi entry ""Arrival"" became the representative contender for that genre.

""Arrival"" went for another routine of humanity being tested by the unknown as multiple spacecraft mysteriously appeared around the world, and the only action being taken is militaries sending in elite teams to investigate and try to communicate in their respective locations. Leading the US elite team is expert linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) as she interprets and understand the mysterious visitors' nature, while the rest of the world is under fearful impression that would lead to a global war. To prevent further miscommunication and misunderstanding, Louise and some of her team is on a race against time to get answers, even if it means risking her life and possibly mankind as well.

When the movie ended, the one word that kept repeating in my head is ""something"". The movie was quite something by its aestheticizing atmosphere from Adams' performance to the conceptual approach towards the mystery with couple conventions and the twist through diegetic clarification. Speaking of the twist, it's a fresh experience when reversing how it was presented to the actuality of those scenes, even though it was an apparent main idea that may need another look at to see how whole the idea is. The climatic revelation is a different spin to the one in ""Interstellar"", within the similar encounter seen in ""Independence Day"" with a more gentle, yet cautious approach, while the cinematography seem to have a [somewhat] similar vibe to the exhaustive ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

Complimenting on the atmosphere that's immersive when experiencing it in the theater, it's actually the definitive soul of the film rather than the human performances that supports the idea, or the communicative ideology. The main element of the atmosphere is the composed score by Jóhann Jóhannsson, who created a chilling, echoing vibe that dimensionally emphasizes, and resonating from, the presence of the mysterious encounter. It's all part of being overall thrilling next to the topically unfortunate timing of how politics, both domestic and international, decided on drastically threatening measures based on miscommunication and misunderstanding, and we're resonating Banks' stress when racing against time. To sum it up, it's an emotionally engaging experience from thrilling to, in some cases, stressful towards a payoff of a conclusion.

Prior to the experience, nearly a month and a half after its release, Amy Adams' performance is genuinely terrific between the acting level in an artistic film and a sci-fi film, which is what this film is a combination of based on the inspired style at a new twist and added depth.

""Arrival"" is the latest sci-fi entertainment that's worth seeing in the theaters to experience its immersion (like ""Sully"" a few months prior) and smart storytelling through an aesthetic atmosphere, with the human aspect being led by Amy Adams' performance. It's genuinely is one of the best films of the genre, and of the year generally, despite the minimal boost of interest before the reversing flip.

2.5,"There are a bunch of excellent sci-fi themes here for science fiction purists.  However there are a number of flaws that make this movie a less than perfect experience.

PROS:
It presents a thought provoking science fiction theme and the plot has some interesting surprises.  There is also a lot of, at times,  moving emotional content about family and love.

CONS:
This movie moves ploddingly slow.  It is not for those suffering from ADD or who have never watched a movie made prior to 1980.  The movie is also incredibly depressing.  It paints a bleak picture of marriage and international relations.  Don't expect to leave feeling hopeful about life.

However the biggest problem with this movie is the overt and covert propaganda for the usual far left utopian fantasy/nightmares.  First,  as will be increasingly true henceforth,  it is filled with Chinese propaganda.  

China owns much of Hollywood now and thus you will find nods to our current overlords in a lot of recent films.  In this one we find that it is China who leads the worlds consensus,  it is China who is the world's military superpower.  America is helpless to stop China.  Only by appeasing Chinese warlords can we make progress, etc. etc.

Beyond that it is filled with the usual globalist tripe that we have been forced to accept in all media channels.  Global governance good?  Yes.  Fly over rabble evil and stupid?  Yes.

3.0,"Arrival is causing quite a stir in cinemas, it's captivating plot and philosophical nature leaving audiences speechless. The reasons why are clear, but I 
couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. Was it a great movie? Yes. But was it the best of the year? No, not in my opinion. Mild spoilers ahead in what 
could be one of my more controversial reviews. 

Directed by Dennis Villeneuve based on the short story 'Story of your Life' by Ted Chiang, the film follows linguist Louise, played by Amy Adams, and 
physicist Ian, played by Jeremy Renner, being recruited to deal with the sudden arrival of 12 alien ships across the globe. There's no denying this is a 
well crafted movie, expertly directed by Villeneuve. There are a number of truly breathtaking shots, really taking advantage of the scale of the ships 
and nature that surrounds them. The cinematography is truly beautiful and is worth the price of entry alone just to see it. 

The acting is also a key part. Amy Adams is definitely on track for an Oscar for her performance in this film, her brave but confused languages expert 
going up against the stubborn male army generals making for an interesting role. Her relation with her daughter is also incredibly well done, especially 
when looked back after the film has ended. Renner's character is given less to do but is excellent given his lack of material. I thought his scientific 
background would be used as a foil to Louise's language background but this wasn't really played upon, with Renner simply being pushed to the back 
with a forced relationship because the plot demanded it. This is more a problem with the writing than the acting however and the cast certainly do an 
excellent job. 

The soundtrack by Jóhann Jóhannsson is also very well done, combining uplifting and warm music for intimate and family scenes and scary, alien 
sounds for scenes involving the extra-terrestrials. The effects for the most part are good with the ships in particular looking incredible. There is one 
particular scene involving a Heptapod, the alien species, appearing in a room which is meant to be shocking but falls very flat due to the unconvincing 
CGI. 

The film features a twist ending, not a sudden one in the same nature of The Sixth Sense, but instead revealed slowly and can be guessed quite early 
on by the more invested viewers. The nature of time plays into the ending with questions raised about ""if you could change the future..."". This is the 
issue I have, as Louise makes a choice which seems incredibly selfish. While it can be argued she had no choice due to paradoxes and similar time 
cliches, none of these ideas were explored to any degree to make this seem definite and even so, makes the whole topic of ""changing the future"" 
irrelevant and not worth mentioning earlier. The lack of free will for the protagonist also seems like a dark tonal shift against the optimistic nature of 
the film so far. However, a disappointing ending with more focus on the journey seems rather apt given the subject matter of the movie. 

While this review comes across as very negative in tone, the film is actually very good. It's positive aspects certainly outweigh the negatives and I 
seem to be in the minority as many critics have given the film highly positive reviews. I definitely feel this demands a rewatch, especially with 
knowledge of the ending, which may raise my opinion of the film a little higher. It's definitely worth your time and is worth seeing on the big screen for 
the cinematography alone. Despite its drawbacks, I would recommend the film and expect to hear more about it at the next Academy Awards.",Dan S,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Dec 19, 2016",Dan S,/user/id/975853955,RT,975853955,

4.5,"ARRIVAL : 4.5/5

All right! So to break the ice without verbose explanations, let me just say : This movie is brilliant! As brilliant as a movie on science fiction can be - an originality of its own, and no cluttered baggage.

Now, to comprehend the brilliance of this movie, one has to take a solitary step back and try to recall all the sci-fi movies which were conceptually mind-blowing, original, and overwhelmed you so much with its broadened horizons , you could literally feel dizzy?! What comes to mind? Alien? Interstellar? Blade Runner? Matrix? Inception? Yes! I am talking about such conceptual brilliance in a movie. And Arrival passes it with flying colors - sometimes so overwhelming, it surpasses the benchmarks too.

Coming straight to the script - the beauty and realism of a protagonist who is unperturbed by the commotion around regarding an unknown event, sets the tone of the movie. Unlike in-your-face surrealistic heroism, the people with knowledge tend to be realistically unaware of the happenings - especially when such an extra-terrestrial event takes place.

The design of the space-ship and its locales are just so haunting and mind-numbing, it translates from the emotions and mannerisms of the actors in the movie to the audience seamlessly. Same goes with the design of the aliens which is unique in its own might, and reminiscent of the haunting originality of the Alien franchise. But what takes the cake - is the graphic language of the aliens which is so unique and interesting - one may never even fathom such creativity. All of it while the earthlings were unable to communicate via the audible approach being used by the aliens - another realistic incidence of such a contact!

It is not unrealistically snappy as it takes the protagonists hard work and time to even begin to comprehend the subtleties of the alien linguistics, and the translation is mostly lost. This is one of the best representations of such a scenario, as one does not simply create a dictionary for a species in a day. Not to forget the other subtle but important precedence of various alien ships landing in various parts of the world - and not only in America (a hilarious joke among non-residents of USA).

This movie is haunting and beautiful on so many levels : The music is numbing and characteristically ""alien"" which transcends the various fears and emotions of the characters into the audience without trying too much. The visuals are mind-boggling and overwhelming - reminiscent of Alien and Interstellar, but more subtle, haunting and less heroic. The story itself with its great twist (a trope of Shyamalan) and the concept of time ( like Interstellar), has a beautiful philosophical and emotional value, almost unseen in the majority of science fiction flicks.

The best quality of this movie is that it subtly takes away from the alien event, and rather focuses on the emotions, consequences and life-changing transformations of the earthlings and the people surrounding the event. It does not make the aliens the incident of importance - but rather a process which changes and focuses on the conscience of the human race.

Let me warn you though - this is not a movie for the audience who want snappy and action-packed entertainment from a science-fiction movie. In some parts, the movie is rather boring, as it delves deeper into the comprehension of the event, and in the end, it is just plain acceptance and moving on - there is no big climax waiting to happen. Also, to add to the frailty - the CGI in some parts of the movie is questionable, considering that it was such a well-made movie with high production value.

It may seem like this movie tries to borrow from franchises like Alien and Interstellar, but in the end, it creates its own unique world and manages to shelve away any such comparisons- thus creating an original idea and sci-fi masterpiece altogether. It is a fresh addition into the big names which redefined the genre of sci-fi easily sitting beside Matrix. Blade Runner or Alien.

Verdict : Brilliant and redefining cinema, and one of the masterpieces in science fiction. 4.5/5

4.0,"This movie took major props from Contact. Spoilers follow. I also really liked Arrival end it added some original storylines, but by and large Contact was all over that movie:

- Jodie Foster's relative dies early in the movie and is revisited via a flashbacks. Same with Amy Adam's character.

- Foster has a ""science vs faith"" romantic interest. Adams has a ""science vs liberal arts"" romantic interest.

- Big government is constantly pressuring Foster and nearly taking her project away from her, same with Adams

- Foster and team spend a good portion of the movie decrypting a signal sent from aliens. Same with Adams.

- In Contact a subversive tries to blow up machine and individuals die. Same in Arrival.

- In the book Contact, the message they finally decrypt is pi (a circle that appears on the screen in binary form; this doesn't make an appearance in the movie, but it is the culmination of the book). In arrival the aliens are also communicating via circles.

5.0,"Arrival is the restrained sci-fi movie that we've wanted for years, not the over-the-top action movie where humans vs. everything else inevitably leads to humans winning. It turns the trope of aliens being exactly what we're afraid of them being on its head to show us a mirror of who we could be. The acting is genuine and immersive, which gives the audience more of a sense that the players are actually in the situation that the plot presents, rather than a visual representation of how the ideal person would react to a situation if they had a week in the shower to think about each line. Some parts aren't as memorable as others, but Amy Adams does a brilliant job of leading the audience through the story by simultaneously exploring the plot as the audience and revealing just the right amount to keep the outcome in the air until the very end.

The visuals help the story, but don't dominate it. They're immersive, believable, but distinctly science fiction, which is a refreshing change from the earth-shattering explosions, giant monsters, mech suits and green screen overuse that dominate so many other movies these days.

Arrival is a stunning movie that I fear far too few people will see. Slow, thoughtful, beautifully filmed science fiction is probably a niche area. This movie sits somewhere in between Interstellar with concepts and visual appeal, and a movie like The Notebook in terms of creating memorable emotional scenes. Yep, Interstellar and The Notebook. From the opening sequence I was deeply moved in a way that I haven't felt since Up. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are so soft, nervous and lovable. This is not an alien movie to make you run in terror. The alien presence is really just a backdrop to make you feel true human emotion. And those two leads win you over and take you on a wonderful journey.

5.0,"* Review without spoilers * 

Wonderful... I came out of the cinema telling myself that it was certainly one of my favorite movies of all time. After, of course, in hindsight, we can relativize, but this movie will subjugate you, whatever your cinematographic tastes are. Some will say that this movie is a cousin of Interstellar, others will speak about 2001: a space odyssey... There are indeed some similarities between these movies. Some places will make you think of Kubrick, the scientific popularization will make you think of Nolan, but with Villeneuve, everything takes a completely different level. Not necessarily a higher level, but a completely different level. Arrival is a more human movie than those mentioned above and has a higher level of reflection. 

From the first second, we dive into the story and we never really emerge, even once the screen has turned white again. Throughout the movie you will think, you will ask yourself questions, you will have doubts... 
The trailer is nothing compared to the entire movie, you will necessarily be surprised. 
The film direction is really amazing. Villeneuve takes his time and lets live some strong shots. 
The actors are very good, and Amy Adams is obviously excellent (will she finally win an oscar after 5 losses ?). 
Even the soundtrack is perfect. If you are interested in this subject, go around the internet and you will realize that there is something special about the music, something related to the very purpose of the movie. 

The blend of all this makes it a pure piece of jewelry. Chills have crossed my body several times and especially during the first 5 minutes, which is extremely rare. I wont say more to avoid spoilers, but I will ask you to go watch it and make your own opinion.

5.0,"Easily one of the best Sci-Fi film I have ever seen. It is a smart film with clever writing, direction and great acting. The overall story is well thought through and our investment, as viewers, pays off in the end with the clever and fulfilling ending. 
This movie is a new page on the genre of sci-fi because of how this film handles alien invasion. It is not as fun as Independence day or as visually impressive as gravity or Interstellar but it is smarter and more realistic film than all of them combined. The director does a great job of convincing us that the events in this film is actually happening and all the actors and the societies reaction to this alien threat is genuine and grounded which is rare in sci-fi films nowadays. It is a sophisticated film with complex, yet, effective story.
 It is a bit of a slow burner which makes this film not everyone's cup of tea. It is not a ""pop-corn"" flick film.It is not a ""fun"" or ""action-packed"" film. It is a ""smart"" film.
It is a ""thought-provoking"" film. I highly recommend  this film. This film is in my top 5 films of 2016 and it is also in my top 5 Sci-Fi films of all time.

5.0,"Director Denis Villenueve brings us a rather different film that proves that bold new takes on familiar films can pay off in his latest film: Arrival. While not much was revealed in the trailers, believe me when I say that Arrival is well worth your time and stands as one of the most visceral and outstanding film experiences in years. Out of respect for the filmmakers who have taken much effort in concealing this film's secrets, I will only discuss what is revealed in the trailers. With that said, lets dive into one of 2016?s best films.

The key to any great film is to take a cliche and turn it in a way to make a story feel original and that is just what Eric Heisserer did with this screenplay. The story here is very simple but so intricately detailed that you simply can't help but get invested in this film. The plot revolves around a linguist, named Louise Banks, who gets recruited by the government to make contact with aliens who have randomly appeared all over the globe. This is literally the basic plot and the entire film with her and her partner trying to make some form of conversation with the aliens. the writer's decision to tell a character based story rather than a big action feature is just what this film needed. The subdued nature of the story as well as the character development is nothing short of captivating. To top it all off the payoff of this film is incredible with one of the finest twists in recent memory.

The acting here is also phenomenal with Amy Adams starring as the main character Louise. Adams' delivery is spectacular with so much heart and drama that she has you pulling for her all the way through the film. Jeremy Renner plays her partner and provides the necessary weight to counteract the areas that Louise's character lacks. The two have impeccable chemistry and easily carry this film from start to finish. On top of that we get a great performance from Forrest Whitaker as well as Michael Stuhlbarg who represent the government in the film.

The real star of the film however is Denis Villeneueve in the director's chair as well as the cinematography and sound department. This film looks stunning from start to finish with shots that will warp your mind and give you chills. Not only that but Villeneueve's pacing is perfect all the way through. This is a film with no real action of any kind but he makes it fly by with little to no downtime. Each scene is constructed in a way that you are in suspense and intrigue through the entire film and you just can't help but get totally wrapped up in the events of this film.The sound is also chilling because majority of the film is silent with just the right mount of music throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Villeneueve always makes fantastic films but Arrival just might be his crowning achievement.

All in all Arrival is a masterclass in scifi and drama. The story is written expertly, the acting is fantastic, and the direction, cinematography, and sound all blend together and are absolutely flawless. I didn't discuss everything for the sake of the secrets of the film, so do yourself a favor and experience this film on the big screen for a one of a kind experience.",Tracy S,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 11, 2016",Tracy S,/user/id/816271443,RT,816271443,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/829113258/picture

4.5,"On the positive side:  l liked the music, which I felt really set the mood throughout the movie.  I can usually tell in the first minute or two if I'll like a movie by the music and the first scenes.   I loved the fascination with language and the addition of the relativity of time as a factor in how the movie plays out.  I liked that no one has done something exactly like this before and I couldn't really guess what was going to happen (although nothing really happens much at all throughout the movie, at least not in the current time).  I'm confused by all the people saying that the ending didn't make sense or was a let down.  It seemed to me that the ending was the logical result of all of the visions that she was having, and it didn't take a genius to figure out where that was going, at least after awhile. Overall,  I thought it was cool.  I love movies that play tricks with time.    I liked that it left a lot to wonder about, and yet it also left me feeling that it wasn't complete, and I wished that there were more to the movie. I felt it was only the first chapter in a good classic sci fi book and I wanted to keep reading. I wonder if the written version goes into any more detail.  I would like to read this story in a longer, more detailed, book.  On the negative side, I felt that the desire of the nations, and evidently of some rogue soldiers, to destroy the ships so quickly was a bit contrived and a little unbelievable, yet a generally acceptable, although overdone, theme in a sci fi movie.",Reve K,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 11, 2016",Reve K,/user/id/919880093,RT,919880093,

5.0,"One of my favorite movies of 2016. Itâ??s not often that a movie whose main plot point is that aliens have arrived from outer space makes us think deeply about the actions we take as humans, but that is exactly what Arrival does. It is also why it is one of my favorite movie of 2016. The people who will be disappointed are those coming to the theater looking for this to be an onslaught of invasion/ID4 type special effects thrills. It is a deeply thoughtful movie with sci-fi elements.
 
 I think many people have dismissed this film as â??just another alien arrival movieâ?? but it is so much deeper than that. It is a movie that is far more cerebral than it is celluloid. There are the kinds of things the thinking sci-fi fan will revel in. This movie taps into emotions in a way that is subtle and not manipulative. The story is presented with just the right sense of urgency that keeps you interested, but not overwhelmed. The success of this film in my opinion is largely the result of two key things: Its Director, Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners), and the lead actress, Amy Adams.
 
 The story focuses on Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a renowned linguist and college instructor living a quiet life after the death of her child. Quiet, until the day 12 huge mysterious orbs appear around the world and the military determines she is their best chance at getting a dialogue going with these aliens. Jeremy Renner plays Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist. Yes, itâ??s geeky like that and he will prove key to the story. 
 
 Villeneuve has created something that is both imaginative, fulfilling, and masterfully done. Arrival is already garnering Oscar-buzz with its 10 Critics Awards nominations recently announced and I predict it will go on to garner some Oscar nods as well. It may have been out for over a month now, but it is still not too late to catch this movie that will be talked about for quite some time.",Camilo A,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 11, 2016",Camilo A,/user/id/951550626,RT,951550626,

4.0,"Arrival: diversity, tolerance and unity, should be embraced through skillful communication, in the light of challenging cultural differences.

Carl Sagan's Contact (1997) was an interesting film about how it will be like to make contact for the first time with an alien civilization, and the story danced around the conflicting rhetoric of God vs. Science. Arrival feels like Contact for a new generation, it is a hunting movie with a similar rhythm and pretences to sound persuasive about something, in this case: how peace in the world can be achieved through skillful communication, in times of globalization and cultural differences.

I have a bachelor degree in Social Communications and Multimedia, while attending University, I enjoyed my linguistic and semiotics classes, in fact, I completed my thesis by making a semiotic analysis of one advertisement campaign. I am bilingual, and for these two reasons, this movie stroke a chord close to my own personal experiences with language and communication. I understand the difficulties in communicating messages across different languages and mediums, it is not an easy task to come across with the original intended message. I was taught about how most of the problems in our societies are due to poor communication, and since then, it is an idea that I get to live with forever. The movie captures that idea very well to my surprise.
The story begins with a hunting narration about time...then, we see Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor, losing her daughter to cancer, and later, we find Louise yanked out in the middle of a quest to make contact with an alien civilization who just landed on earth in spaceships with a half-sliced egg form hoovering above earth around the world. Louise is contacted by the US Army to help the make contact by deciphering their language with hopes to understand their intentions before attempting an act of war.

The tone of the movie is hunting and no real action scenes ever take place, it is a very close experience to Contact, with amazing photography and sound effects, so, if what you are looking to see is an action packed film, like Independence Day, I recommend to skip this movie entirely and move on to a different Sci-Fi film, because Arrival is like an experimental low-tempo indie song, and not a pop-fast-beat dance tune.",Baz O,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 11, 2016",Baz O,/user/id/974908584,RT,974908584,

4.0,"ARRIVAL is one of the most ambitious movies of the year, but that doesn't exactly mean it's one of the BEST movies of the year.  It's strong direction and intellectual approach are unfortunately undone (somewhat) by some of the curious areas the screenplay chooses to focus on.  Essentially a TWILIGHT ZONE episode writ large, ARRIVAL is fundamentally a cerebral, big science fiction tale about language and communication, and in the early going, the movie is basically masterful.  Its first act is an incredibly authentic and believable portrait of how the world would likely react to the appearance of alien vessels on our planet, and director Villeneuve demonstrates that he has tight tonal control as well as a gift for crafting sequences that draw the audience in.  In tandem with the evocative (and at times austere) cinematography and screenplay's intelligent and methodical plotting, the first two acts of ARRIVAL are extremely satisfying.  Amy Adams is effortlessly good, and completely sells her character's skills; this is one of her better performances.  Adams is eventually asked to shoulder the bulk of the movie's emotional content, and this is the arena in which the screenplay stumbles somewhat (though it's no fault of Adams' efforts); the script constructs a major subplot that is, frankly, just not as compelling as the central storyline, and then proceeds to make the denouement almost exclusively about that subplot.  This is a bold choice that will work for some, but not others.  I'm in the ""other"" camp, as the movie basically turns into a different kind of story than the first half sets us up for.  I would have preferred the movie stick with its more heady approach instead of going for the heartstrings, but so it goes.  The script also leaves some of the narrative particulars as things to be inferred by the audience rather than spelled out for them, which I appreciate, but - again - some might want things handled in a somewhat more concrete way.  In the end, ARRIVAL didn't totally click for me on the level it seems it did for others, but I admire the intentions behind the film, and I'm always thankful for intelligent, plausible sci-fi.",Brett B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 09, 2016",Brett B,/user/id/841042781,RT,841042781,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1567891636/picture

5.0,"So I've been wondering how to review this movie. Clearly I think it's amazing based on me giving it 5 stars, but still I found it difficult.  Mostly because of a surprise twist in the middle of the movie that I just was not expecting at all. This twist then leads to a scene which I'm sure some could consider a Deus Ex machina moment. When I first saw the scene I was also thinking ""what the"" but as the movie progressed past it and I thought about it more, I accepted it, even embraced it. I won't talk anymore about so as not to spoil the movie. 

Overall, as I mentioned, I loved this movie. To me it's the Contact of this decade. An intelligent first encounter movie that makes you think and actually makes some sense. No the aliens aren't going to immediately destroy us and some how our military and ingenuity are capable of defeating a species that can traverse the stars. How humanity reacts to the presence of these beings and our own strengths and failings are at the core of this film, just like it was in Contact. 

Also just like in Contact this movie predominantly rests on the shoulders of its heroine, in this case a linguist played by Amy Adams. As much as her performance was panned in that other alien movie (with a red cape) she delivers in this movie. Her non verbal acting really conveys the awe and fear at meeting an alien race for the first time and her surprise at finally understanding why the aliens are here. 

Her supporting cast also did a good job, including Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but really it's Amy Adams who stars in this movie.

3.5,"It's the end of the world as we know it! A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.

I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama Arrival"" where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace... wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?

But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it's only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve - the man behind Prisoners"", mindbending Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sicario"" and currently filming Blade Runner"" sequel -, one could expect Arrival"" to be a thinking person's sci-fi. And one is not wrong.

It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. 

If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar"" crossed with Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life"". 

Robert Zemeckis's Contact"" (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival"" also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.

I haven't read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that Arrival"" is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. 

So it's nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams's great performance. 

She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. 

This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in Interstellar"" but decidedly less showoffish.

So it's mostly Adams's one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. 

The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. 

As stated above, I don't know the original story but ""Arrival's"" message is rather spiritual and not ""dry"" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind's future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. 

It's a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.

Overall, Arrival"" is a good movie although I wasn't especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something impressive"" just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. 

I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie's overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.

But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don't prioritize explosions, Arrival"" is good to go.",Kapten V,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Dec 09, 2016",Kapten V,/user/id/975792872,RT,975792872,

Review pequeña:

Uno de los principales propósitos del arte son: 1. Entregar un mensaje y 2. Hacer sentir algo. Siendo, a mi parecer, mucho más importante el primero, ya que también abarca el segundo, al menos en el cine. Especialmente en el cine más comercial.

En resumen, Arrival, muy centrada en el diálogo, profundiza mucho en un solo tema (la gran importancia del lenguaje y de la comunicación) y logra entregar un mensaje y una moraleja, a diferencia de muchísimas películas actuales que tratan de abordar varios temas para ser entretenidas, pero como consecuencia no logran desarrollar a fondo ninguno y terminan diciendo nada. Además, posee una narrativa un poco más compleja de lo habitual, pero a la vez muy bien ordenada a través de un buen montaje (orden en que aparece cada escena).

En cuanto a su arte: tiene diseños creativos (naves, lenguaje, aliens), algunos momentos con bella fotografía y un soundtrack que a veces escapa a la repetida fórmula actual de Hollywood mediante un sonido original. Todo muy digno de un sci-fi. Ya que estas cosas no son el centro de la película, se encuentran solo en la medida exacta, pero con cariño y personalidad. Algo que, sin importar su cantidad, se agradece mucho, ya que en general es difícil encontrar cariño en el trabajo del arte de las grandes producciones hoy en día. 

Al final, lo más importante de todo es que logra cumplir en dos horas el objetivo de desarrollar bien un tema y entregarnos el mensaje que quería su autor.",Jorge F,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Dec 08, 2016",Jorge F,/user/id/818389083,RT,818389083,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/551072470/picture

5.0,"Arrival is one of the best that I have seen this year! Right from the jump you get an amazing opening sequence that to me really attaches you to the character Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. And this is one of her stand out performances so far in her career. I went in to this movie completely blind without seeing any reviews or any trailers, so honestly going in I was expecting this movie to be just another ""SIGNS"" type of film that we've seen 1000 times. But the way they did this film was beautiful, like they way they focused on the communication aspect and not just the war that you often see from films of this nature, so it felt very fresh and new and exciting. And most of that was carried by Amy Adams and the way she was able so easily to connect with the aliens, it seemed like she was really talking to them. Sticking to the actors and there performances in this film, in this movie Jeremy Renner plays a scientist, that is kind of like Amy Adams side kick in away, I just wish they would have done more with him and his character, because I feel like Renner has never really gotten an opportunity to shine in a movie like this, it feels like his character is never used to his full potential, and I think Renner is a very talented actor that just hasn't gotten that golden opportunity. 

Another thing I really enjoyed is the directing of this film by director, Gavin O'Connor, who has directed things like Warrior in 2011, and more recently The Accountant in 2016. O'Conner just does amazing in this film, like the first scene that you actually see the alien pods, it just blows you away. He really steals the show in this movie, it is honestly some of his absolute best work ever!

Now lets talk about the ending... I don't want to get into any spoilers, but to me although I loved the ending, if feel like it would've been better if they further explained it. It felt so rushed at the end and leaves you asking questions. Most of the ending makes perfect sense but there is just this one aspect that doesn't quite add up. 

All in all this movie is one of the best of the year hands down, I would definitely recommend this film!

4.0,"Very slow-building and thought provoking, ""Arrival"" was the latest masterpiece from Denis Villeneuve, one of the best working directors in films right now.

3.5,"A Chegada poderia ter sido o melhor filme do ano. E chegou perto, estava quase lá. Dois tropeços, no entanto, fizeram o filme passar de uma obra mestra a um filme ""muito bom, mas que poderia ter sido tanto mais"".

O primeiro (e menor) é perceptível no momento que surge, que é a necessidade de preencher a cota da ""fórmula hollywoodiana de filmes"", em especial de sci-fi, ao colocar as ""diferentes formas"" que os países entendem e respondem à chegada dos aliens. Desnecessário, proselitista e maniqueísta, pasteuriza algo que poderia ter sido substituído por algum outro argumento bem mais inteligente e bem menos ""preconceito americano/hollywoodiano"" com relação ao resto do mundo. Soou como uma necessidade de cumprir um requisito básico da produtora, que espera que um filme de ficção científica tenha.

O segundo é descobrir, na segunda metade do filme, que todo o enredo e questionamento até ali nada mais foi do que um artifício de roteiro, um ""plot device"", um acessório/muleta para justificar o verdadeiro enredo do filme, que é um drama pessoal baseado em uma premissa de ""tempo cíclico"". O Drama em si é muito bonito, e a ideia básica do filme, sua história, visual e tudo o mais realmente foram muito bem montados e tudo MUITO bonito. Mas, ao chegar ao fim, fiquei me perguntando se, caso o artifício usado fosse outro, e não alienígenas, faria qualquer diferença na história. Um desenvolvimento de quase 1 hora de filme é desperdiçado ao não se criar uma função real para ele na história, além de servir de pano de fundo ao drama pessoal da protagonista. Os aliens chegam, colocam um mistério e vão embora sem qualquer impacto, e sem que esse mistério demonstre qualquer nível de relação com a mensagem principal do filme. Não só os aliens poderiam ser substituídos por qualquer elemento ""sobrenatural"" (ou até mesmo natural) que o autor quisesse: ainda é proposto no filme uma questão ""a ser resolvida"" neste aspecto, que nunca é mencionado novamente, como se tivessem esquecido de que aquilo necessitava algum tipo de resolução, ou se o filme tivesse perdido seus 20 minutos finais. E no fim te deixam pensando ""ok... e tudo isso para o que, mesmo?"".

Há muitas referências interessantes no filme, e várias fontes de onde parece ter ""bebido"": A Origem, 2001 Uma Odisseia no Espaço, Contatos Imediatos de 3º Grau, Contato (esse último faz uma presença perceptível, aliás), entre outros, são evocados, mas parece que faltou ""um pedaço"", ao não vincular todos os dilemas levantados pelo choque entre Humanidade-Aliens com os outros aspectos do filme.

Acabamos com uma excelente ideia, desenvolvida pela metade, e sem um fechamento de ""tempo cíclico"", tão falado e trabalhado ao longo da história.

4.5,"Que maravilloso ver una película que aun siendo una película de alto presupuesto tiene muy presente que el cine solía ser el 7mo ARTE. Es que para mi el cine blockbuster está tan mal hoy (lleno de franquicias, segundas partes, festivales de efectos especiales para público fácilmente impresionable, muchas películas que son una sucesión de escenas sin sentido ni peso dramático cercano a la realidad, etc etc. Mucho amor por el dinero y poca pretensión artística) que ya se está cayendo de esa definición. Si tienes algo que decir, algún punto de vista que aportar, y lo haces a través de metáforas, ya sea musicales, visuales, literarias, etc, wn, eso es ARTE. Los autores de ""Arrival"" tienen algo que decir, y utilizan toda la película para canalizar brillantemente su visión de la vida. Y por momentos casi hasta llega a ser un breve estudio de la raza humana.

Que delicadeza de película que es ""Arrival"". Sus premisas son bastantes simples, pero me parecen bien desarrolladas. Me parece super atinado, encuentro muy poco real cuando en las películas pasan cosas brígidas a cada rato. La vida no es así. La peli intenta graficar de la forma más seria posible como sería enfrentar un primer contacto con una raza extraterrestre, y a partir de cierto punto se la juega valientemente por sus ideas creativas. Le encontré influencia de ""Encuentros cercanos del 3er tipo"". Tb se podría decir que va + o - en la línea de películas ciencia ficción inteligentes tipo ""Interestelar"", ""Gravedad"" o ""2001 Odisea del espacio"". Pero tiene identidad propia, años más adelante creo que se hablará de ""Arrival"" por sus méritos. 

Creo que la peli tiene toda la sutileza que suelen NO tener las películas sobre aliens, lo que por supuesto la hace más creíble. Que delicia ver una película de ciencia ficción sin que se flaitee (Lo que para mi es cuando ofrece una sobresaturación de efectos especiales y explosiones a diestra y siniestra a propósito de nada). Tb creo que para los temas que trata la edición de la película está hecha de forma impecable.

By closing her damn eyes and then some cute flashbacks about her Daughter, about a Chinese man whispering to her ears and she made a phone call repeating the same words and then saved the world.

You can't even prove what kind of aliens they are, did not explain anything bout how she changed the future( all they had was that phone call) and did not say anything bout the father, nor the daughter, nor herself, just the language(Only shown some drawings). So, tell me, HOW is that so unexpectedly amazing that it can get 8.4? Fucking dumb movie that gets 8.4 imdb due to typical idiots who vote it high just because they think it's so mind blowing. Okay. The movie is constantly showing flashbacks that makes no sense for any plot building or story building, no, none. Not even close. Not shocked to know that who's the father. And after so long watching the movie hoping that it will finally show something that has a POINT, THEN comes the word weapon, makes the soldiers panic blabla. Erm, can I ask, why? And what's the point? You wasted my fucking time learning (or just seeing you people in the move learning) some ink language FOR SO LONG, and then suddenly a word comes up, weapon. Okay. That's sooooo good! 8.4 yay! You deserve this! Oh please for fuck sakes end your miserable and immature thoughts please. And what the hell is with the phone call thing? Yea yea one phone call saves the world and where the hell is the critical moment in the movie?

Why not to understand each other by communication and see how it goes and helping other. That is to the point we are civilized and respect because they show no aggression and wanted to help.

Arrival was almost a complete 180.  I loved the premise, but somewhere after 20 minutes I found myself getting a bit uninterested in part due to its slow pace.  Don't get me wrong, Amy Adams is, and will always be, a fantastic actress.  She had a lot of touching scenes in this movie, but even she couldn't hold a flat drawn out plot in the middle.  With that being said, the ending left me speechless.  Knowing the finale now, maybe I would have found the beginning somehow more interesting.

There are some interesting elements, but the pacing is slow. The payout isn't enough to erase the slow pace of the movie. The movie feels like it is in two halves. A strong opening where these aliens arrive and there is all this potential, and then the effort to resolve the aliens' presence as quickly as possible to get back to the story about the human protagonist. The storytelling starts to rely on exposition through the end. The movie also uses vagueness to disguise some plot holes, which made it feel like the writer didn't actually know the answers to the questions raised about philosophy and time.

5.0,"In 1961 two iconic science fiction novels were first published: ""Solaris"" by Stanislaw Lem and ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" by Robert Heinlein. Both novels inform the story of ""Arrival"". ""Solaris"" is a meditation on memory and the difficulties of communication and, as portrayed in the superb Russian cold-war era film by Tarkovsky, on the dangers of miscommunication. ""Stranger ..."" builds on the idea that learning a extraterrestrial language has the capacity to radically alter human perception and so, human capabilities. This is not pure speculation and the interactions between brain function and language are an active area of research.

""Arrival"" is an exceptional film that builds on the concepts introduced by Lem and Heinlein. And in its full implications can even be considered profound. In addition to its conceptual intensity, ""Arrival"" is superbly acted by Amy Adams and supporting caste. The score, with Max Richter's ""On the Nature of  Daylight"" at the beginning and end the film, matches the mood and the story line perfectly.

""Arrival"" is the best sci-fi film that I have seen in years and a film that will stay with for many years to come.",brad c,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Dec 04, 2016",brad c,/user/id/973017280,RT,973017280,
4.5,"""The arrival"" reminds me of several other films, such as signs, interstellar and even melancholy, because like all these examples he tries to bring something new, and succeeds. We have here a film that goes beyond the classic cliché of alien invasion, we have a philosophical film, it really is not easy to be digested, but it takes, ""The arrival"" talks about time, life, future expectations, peace and unity , All with a seemingly simple plot. ""An alien ship lands on the ground and a linguist is called to try to communicate with her,"" yeah, that synopsis can fool you, and a lot. The linguist in question is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), in trying to communicate with these extraterrestrials she ends up learning to see the world in another way ... Technically the film is also incredible, with many scenes of filming in off , Spike Jonze style, he plays the melodramatic way flawlessly and with a beautiful photograph, mixes and beautiful soundtrack, the film places Denis Villeneuve as one of the biggest names in the new generation of cinema that is emerging, and is not For less, Denis is spectacular, we must also talk about the acting, Amy Adams is incredible, perfectly interpreting all the news and dramas that passes his Louise. Finally, ""The arrival"" is a good news, it is a film that goes beyond its two hours, is a film that goes beyond that cheap science fiction, it has a message, even if we could change the bad things that happened in our Lives, it would not be worth it, because it is these things that build the human being, Congratulations Denis Villeneuve.",ANDERSON G,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 04, 2016",ANDERSON G,/user/id/974807001,RT,974807001,

1.5,"I went to see ""Arrival"" today at the Alamo. In summary, it was terrible. I heard good things about it, and really like the cast, but yes, it was terrible. The aliens and their language were the only good thing about it - no complaints there, they were cool and could have been fascinating. If you need more detail, I would call this mess ""Beautiful Wim Wenders-style incomprehensible gibberish. It was as if ""Contact"" (1997) and ""Until the End of the World"" (1991) had a baby, and then that baby snacked on lead-based paint until it was old enough to vote.
Instead of action, drama, tension, conflict, or a plot, the viewer is treated to:
-Complete waste of a very good cast, to the point that even Forest Whitaker must have had Forest Whitaker Eye. 
-Soft-washed flashbacks straight out of a Hallmark condolence card used to substitute for a coherent plot.. not all sciencey like ""Interstellar"", either. Just, ""lazy writer"". 
-Poignant strings and piano music to stress how poignant the moment is, not so overpowering as Hans Zimmer's keyboard in ""Interstellar"", but more like having George Winston as an inconsiderate roommate. . 
-PopSci mention of Sapir-Whorf, a linguistics concept that's been around a very long time, yet the best linguists on the planet need a refresher. 
-High ranking military guys that are rigid and inflexible to the point of caricature, or low ranking military guys who are bloodthirsty and stupid to the point of caricature.
-Months of worldwide mania and panic at the arrival of aliens who land in the middle of nowhere, do nothing but stay in their ships, 
have no measurable impact with the environment, and cheerfully allow humans to regularly come aboard for the purpose of bumbling through attempts at communication at a leisurely pace, showing no frustration or menacing gestures of any sort. 
-CNN style newscaster exposition, the 21st century version of the spinning newspaper that says ""ALIENS LAND ON LAS VEGAS!""
-Fast forward through voiceovers, and other hamfisted exposition.",Andrew B,False,False,False,False,1.5,"Dec 04, 2016",Andrew B,/user/id/975792628,RT,975792628,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154132906832284/picture
5.0,"This alien invasion movie from the director of last years drug cartel thriller Sicario and next years Blade Runner sequel, Denis Villeneuve, is brimming with smart ideas about language, time and what it means to be human.

When aliens come to Earth its usually for one of two reasons. They either come in peace or with plans to attack, hell bent on wiping out the human race and taking over the planet. Whichever is their intention its usually evident very early on in the film. Not so with Arrival, which gives nothing away.

The film begins with the arrival of 12 mysterious alien spaceships that hang sentinel over the planet. Until someone figures out one very simple question: what do they want? the aliens are both friends and foes. The US government calls in Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a renowned professor of linguistics and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) a theoretical scientist to help establish communication and find out the visitors intentions. At every other site where the strange, pod-like crafts have appeared, world leaders are also trying to talk to the aliens. Up against the doomsday clock of growing global paranoia as mankind verges on interplanetary war, Banks and Donnelly must decipher the language of the alien species and discover their purpose for visiting Earth to safeguard the future of mankind.

Arrival, adapted from a short story by Ted Chiang called Story of Your Life, is a powerful and heartfelt portrayal of humankind's reaction to first contact. The screenplay by Eric Heisserer screenplay is sophisticated and gripping and Villeneuve has a show stopping reveal up his sleeve. Whilst it's a very intelligent science fiction movie, it's also a very accessible. Theres a lot that should be hard to get your head around but Villeneuve makes incredibly complicated concepts simple. The visuals created by cinematographer Bradford Young are astonishingly beautiful and theres an atmospheric score composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson.

Adams is absolutely terrific in a stand out central performance as an emotionally scarred woman facing what feels like impossible challenges. She is ably supported by the affable Renner who is given a chance to showcase his acting talent outside of the action movie realm. But the film belongs to Adams who provides the film's emotional core.

This ambitious, multi layered drama joins films like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Ridley Scotts The Martian as a mature, thoughtful piece of science fiction. An instant sci-fi classic and definite Oscar worthy contender.

It thinks it's far smarter than it actually is. We could debate the themes, or lack thereof, but let's just stick to the biggest flaws that ruin this film. Characters - paper-thin backstories or non existent. The main character loses a child to cancer in the first 30sec montage. Result? I don't care. And THAT was the best character. They give dribs and drabs of her past but it's crosscut between two confusing timelines of the past and future. The antagonists goal - if we're talking about the cookie cutter humans - boring. If we're talking about the aliens - WTF!? They state their goals, which are both here and in the future, but we see VERY little of the former and NONE of the latter. The music - where the special effects started and where the music began was often not clear. At first we hear the spaceships sounding like humpback whales; then we hear the music sounding like whales... or was that the sfx? I've never had such a muddled auditory experience in a movie before.

It caught most people in the theatre, including myself, by surprise even though looking back, you could see the movie provided a lot of hints for it. The problem is, an exciting last 5 minutes does not justify the stale first 90 minutes of the movie.

The plot twist with the ""flashbacks"" also provides no explanation on how the ""universal language"" works and how it can help a human see the future. As a Sci-Fi, Interstellar puts this movie to shame with ideas and theories that can be researched and a thrilling story.

Also, as the alien told Adams, ""We have come to help you now so you can help us in the future."", what was so wrong on Earth that it urgently needed help?

4.5,"4.5/5.0 stars

Fascinating movie.  A science fiction movie in its purest form. Exploring the what if and taking you on a journey. 

So much of this movie was executed to perfection.  The movie was disorienting- but as it should be.  The characters were very real and human.  And the journey was engaging and interesting.  

The first 1 hour and 58 min (or so) were a great story that stood on their own.  And then in the last two minutes they hit you with a twist that is so big your head just reels.  I actually can't tell yet if that last twist makes the movie a better movie or a worse movie.  I can't fully get my head around it and I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for a while.  It's that sort of movie where you walk out wondering and thinking. 

Note: After the movie I went and read some reviews with spoilers that explain the ending and now that I get it, I think it makes it an even better movie.  One of those movies where you want to go back and re-watch the movie with the new information to see how it changes your perception of the movie.

Now with all of this said I don't think this is a movie for everyone.  I can totally see some people finding it to be too strange or hard to follow.  But I really enjoyed it",Eric R,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Dec 03, 2016",Eric R,/user/id/888746527,RT,888746527,

1.0,"Spoiler alerts do not read if you haven't seen the movie:

Oh where to start with this movie. I would like to say that I am always willing to give a movie a fair chance. Within the time they are given they must remain true to the mission statement and not raise more questions than they answer. In this movies case they raise questions that are unanswerable at all to the western mind, whether you look for answers in the movie or outside it. To an eastern mind set it would fit perfectly to say its rainy outside and within the same thought say its sunny.

My first major beef with this movie is it spends an inordinate amount of time with Louise having flashbacks or memories of a lost child. It is never placed in any time frame and it never really has any relation to a specific time in her life. Next the aliens arrive and she is picked to decipher their communication and help our government understand what they are saying. As the movie unfolds it still isn't clear who Ion is but later we learn it was her husband yet it hasn't happened yet. So the first part of the movie is undisclosed flashbacks .aliens, and Louise interacting with this guy named Ion who is to become her husband later. 
These loosely disjointed sub plots are left loose on purpose i maintain because once the real theme is released that time is all one and not a succession of events as we know it the movie definitely wouldn't make any sense right out of the gate.

So what is the main theme well its that the aliens have a language that empowers a thinking process to view time as a whole.Not only that but by learning this language one can actually come to see time in this way and see all things at the same time. A place where there is no beginning and no end. Which is hilarious really since this theme is introduced and supported in an ongoing time space continuum episode called a movie. Where we have a beginning a middle and an end. This constant irritation pervades the whole movie and is no more glaringly evident as when in the end with the aliens leaving and her in the arms of her future husband Louise declares "" I forgot how good it was to be held by you"" ! Which is an obvious reference to not a memory but to a an actual event she experienced in the future but now was aware of because she saw all of time at once. Then also it is evident when she asks about the alien Abbott and the co alien being in the movie says.."" Oh hes in the process of dying"" which is somehow supposed to alleviate our fears that this movie has bitten off more than it can chew. So what happens when Abbott dies? Do they sit around and see him as there still because clearly that would put a huge marker down in a succession of events that he was no longer there. Hence time is not one event but a series of events creating a beginning a middle and an end.

So its about time...( no pun intended ) and in this case the movie tries to mix seeing all events as one and time itself which has a beginning a middle and an end unsuccessfully. 
It also tries to portray the aliens as ones who through evolution have arrived as the administrators of this great wisdom and that they can teach it to us through their language. 
They are supposed to have come to give us this ability because three thousand years later they are going to need our help somehow which is also strange because of they see all things at the same time why didn't they figure it all out before it happened thus not needing us.

In closing heres the deal Einstein said if you went faster than the speed of light you would go back in time. Yet he also said nothing can go faster than that which just so you can know is 186,000 miles a second. So apparently there remains an assumption that one can conceivably go outside of time and that it is a river if you will but certainly these aliens are not those guys.",Steve L,False,False,False,False,1.0,"Dec 03, 2016",Steve L,/user/id/881523235,RT,881523235,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000032054933/picture

I am curious as to why this movie gets such a high rating when there is such a glaring hole in the story!

I mean her soon-to-be husband is right there with her as she learns it and yet, he apparently has no idea of what is coming! And also, this device had such potential and yet, it was only used for a trite pathos story of a mother choosing to have a child even though she knows she will die young. Really? Why not use this device by having a large majority of earthlings get a glimpse of the future and (the plot device would have to be adapted to allow for new choices in the present to affect the future) change the choices they make to create a better world? Especially since apparently, the Aliens came to give the gift of their language because they will need us in 3,000 years... why is that not addressed at the end of the movie? And finally, if I have to sit through one more sci-fi movie where the main protagonist have to battle uncooperative or hostile army chumps, I am going to lose it!

5.0,"5/5. It's very rare when a film blows me away. I went in suspecting that I would love it, and love feels too inadequate to describe my feelings in response to this film. The story is one of the most original and brilliant I've ever seen on screen. The acting was great, but some of the cast was questionable. But that doesn't take anything away from my admiration for this film. The story kept me engaged and it was so much fun to keep speculating as to what was going on. The directing is just spectacular, subtle when necessary--a subtly that complimented perfectly the heaviness of the story. I cannot wait to see this again. I highly, highly recommend this.

3.5,"The age old question in alien movies is-do they come in peace? In most, that answer comes quickly, with an attack. In other, rarer movies, it takes much longer to get any answers.

4.0,"Se cartaz, sinopse e/ou trailer te fazem acreditar estar diante dum filme pipoca aventuresco com alienígenas, não se engane: é um filme cerebral e reflexivo, mas também pessoal, intimista e sensível, devidamente recheado de ficção científica.

Acho importante alertar que o longa exige do espectador uma atitude de abstração à qual a maioria das pessoas não está acostumada ou pela qual não tem interesse ou não se sente atraída. Já os pesquisadores das Letras ou curiosos e interessados em estudos sobre linguagem terão um atrativo a mais, já que a [dificuldade de] comunicação tem um papel central no filme e precisa ser solucionada pela protagonista  uma linguista. Enquanto ela encara o desafio de decifrar uma gramática ""bidimensional"", com uma sintaxe visual sem relação com a sintaxe da própria língua alienígena falada, sem poder associar fonemas com grafemas, acompanhamos a aplicação de sua metodologia como cientista da linguagem.

Pra quem já teve oportunidade de ler o conto que deu origem ao filme (história, a princípio, tão ""infilmável"" quanto Nas Montanhas da Loucura de Lovecraft), é interessante conferir a solução visual que os produtores deram para representar a mega-abstrata língua escrita dos aliens, formada por aquilo que a linguista suspeita se tratar de ideogramas. 

Os amigos da Linguística e afins ""pegarão a referência"" (cortesia do Capitão América) quando o filme fizer menções à hipótese Sapir-Whorf (a estrutura/propriedades duma língua influenciam/moldam diretamente a cognição, a consciência e a visão de mundo dos usuários dessa língua); porém, essa menção (que não existe no livro) nem é tão adequada assim ao caso abordado. O fato é que as constatações da linguista me lembraram mesmo foi de outra questão que estudei durante meus primeiros semestres na UnB: o que vem antes? O pensamento ou a linguagem? É o pensamento que organiza a linguagem (Piaget) ou a linguagem que organiza o pensamento (Vigotski)? E nem posso contar por que pensei isso, pois soltaria spoilers.

Ninguém perguntou, mas vou responder: o que é melhor? O livro ou o filme? Cada um tem suas virtudes. O conto se aprofunda e se delonga mais na metodologia científica, nas análises linguísticas e nas tentativas de decifrar a linguagem alien. E tudo isso com muita propriedade e conhecimento de causa (palmas para o autor). Já o filme se torna (ainda) mais sensível e poético graças ao talento do diretor, com algumas americanices que não chegam a comprometê-lo.

Ah, e que trilha sonora final belíssima... tá tocando na minha cabeça até agora ?

Eis um filme que te vai fazer ficar pensando muito ou pelo alguma coisa após sair do cinema. ""Caralho... que porra foi aquela?..."". Ele começa e se desenvolve cientificamente em clima de suspense, com intervenções contemplativas, mas se conclui de forma poética.

1.5,"I went to see ""Arrival"" sort of reluctantly because I am not into sci-fi movies with aliens coming to take the world over and a war ensues between the good guys (us) and the Bad (the aliens) and we always win. It was a choice of seeing this movie or ""Rules Don't Apply"" and I am not a fan of Warren Beatty's and I understand it is really a flop so I decided on ""Arrival"".

The main reasons I was interested in seeing ""Arrival"" was because I am becoming a big fan of Amy Adams and on YouTube I saw a video titled ""Arrival Ending Explained"" which intrigued me though I didn't watch it until after I saw the movie.

The first hour of the movie was like watching a foreign language film without subtitles and didn't hold me interest at all. The second hour with the 12 egg-shaped UFOs all over the world set up the standard them versus us but that isn't where it goes.

Amy Adams is Dr. Louise Banks, is a language expert, who had a daughter who died at the age of 12, and is called on to help make contact with the aliens who are named Abbot & Costello by the theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who brings the  very rare humor in the movie. They work together in ways not exactly up to what Colonel Weber, (Forest Whitaker) and a CIA agent played by Michael Stuhlbarg want from them.

The film revolves around Adams and Renner with little time for the other actors except for an important cameo by Tzi Ma who plays the Chinese leader though it is Adams who holds your attention every time she is on screen which is through the whole film.

The film is not about them versus us but about time and how it can be looked at in different ways. We see many scenes with the mother and daughter from birth until her death 12 years later and by the ending these scenes all are looked at in a way that we weren't aware while watching them.

The ending is done subtly by the director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer instead of hammering the audience over the head but I really wished I had watched that YouTube video before I saw the film.

Adams performance is constrained, as it should be, where it could have been melodramatic. When it comes to her what it all is about she calmly accepts and understands what is happening and what happened. Renner is very strong support for her performance.

This is not an 'entertaining' film in the sense you can sit back, munch on your popcorn and enjoy aliens invading earth but to which you have to think.

Some of my favorite films are science fiction; most of my favorite films make me think...you know, really think about the purpose off a film and its effect on my worldview. Arrival is both of those things. No cliches are allowed, from the nature of the aliens to the special effects, this is truly elevated science fiction.

4.0,"Arrival is a science-fiction and drama film released November 11, 2016 starring some big stars like Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. The film primarily takes place in Montana as two professors are sent to study and investigate alien space crafts, or what appear to be, that have landed. The movie is full of suspense and science and is engaging for the audience within the very first few minutes.
The film begins showing a timeline of scenes with Amy Adams, who plays Dr. Louise Banks, and her daughter from the past. The daughter is sick and hospitalized. Present day Dr. Banks is about to teach a lecture to her college class when a student urges her to turn on the TV to the news. Everyone watches in silence as what seem to be space crafts have landed all over the world. A day or two later Dr. Banks is asked to report to the scene of one spacecraft in Montana to infer what this species wants since she is an established linguistics professor. Accompanying her is Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who is sent to help her investigate. The first interaction with the unknown species is very surreal and is the first of many interactions between the two species. The humans begin to break down and try to understand the writing of the other species uses with the time they are given. Since there are twelve space crafts spotted around the world, teams of specialists and professors work together to try and figure out what these so called aliens want. Slowly other nations start to pull away because they believe this a dangerous species that want to harm humans. Dr. Banks does not feel like this the case and truly thinks they are here to help. One day when the military tells everyone they have finished their mission because it is no longer safe, Dr. Banks sneaks away to be alone and interact with this species. What she learns is extraordinary and she must convince others somehow. Dr. Banks is able to see events of the future and uses this to tell the Chinese ruler some information to persuade him to believe what she is saying. Dr. Banks and Donnelly seem to develop a connection with one another and the movie ends leaving many with questions.
The set design for this film was quite unique and futuristic. The scenes in the spacecraft depicted an accurate representation of what one may think it would look like if they ever encountered one. Although the movie really did not travel around much and many of the set backgrounds were used several times, it did not hinder the movie in any way. 
The acting in this film was excellent at tugging at the viewer's emotions while keeping them on their toes. Amy Adams did a fantastic job playing her role as Dr. Banks and made the audience really feel her sadness and willpower all throughout. The actor's performances kept the film from falling dull and really brought the movie to life.
Overall I found this movie to be extremely thrilling and enjoyable. It brought about a range of emotions from sorrow to curiosity and I never felt myself losing interest in it. I do not think younger children or teenagers would find this movie as interesting but I do think a bit older of a crowd would really enjoy the science-fiction drama.

I still do and always will have problems with the third act and I would've very much liked it if they had kept the climax smaller scale, rather than her trying to save the world and stop the Chinese from starting a global war with the aliens.

3.5,"Put your thinking caps on.  You'll need it for this heady sci-fi.  Denis Villeneuve, responsible for stand-out movies like Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario (also thinkers films), brings us Arrival, perhaps the meatiest of them all.  It may involve multiple viewings, but after one and some light internet reading, I was able to fully grasp (OK well at least get close to fully grasping) exactly what the idea Villeneuve and his team had for this film.

The basic premise without spoilers is: how does language, whether written or spoken, help us perceive reality?

Without getting as complex as an official article for the NY or LA Times, Arrival is about understanding how one race understands another.  And I'm talking all of the intricacies.  Cultures are so deep, it takes years upon years to full flesh out.  While we only see a brief glimpse at Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner's characters working on one as alien as the Heptapods', it still strikes a chord along the lines of, can we open our minds to work with others?

While Arrival may feel like a big movie about playing nice with others, there are some massive themes running through this film based off theories about linguistics.  Quite frankly, it's tough to comprehend on one viewing.  Maybe even two.  And while that may have critics lauding over the film and praising it for its inventiveness, the average move-goer will walk out not quite understanding what they just paid $10 for.

The movie, outside of its themes, is superbly done with adequate pacing, tempered dialogue that's not too brash or too over-bearing with long sentences, and fine acting.  

As sci-fi movies are supposed to do (the good ones at least), they are there to open your mind to other-worldy possibilities.  Will everything involved in Arrival be possible in the not-to-distant-future?  No.  Can some of these theories somehow end up being discussed or reopened?

5.0,"Really enjoyed this, as everyone has stated outstanding performance by Amy Adams. Arrival succeeds where few others have in providing an intelligent perspective on the 'first contact' scifi theme, while at the same time managing to engage the viewer just as effectively on an emotional level and playing cleverly on the ambiguity of the term 'arrival'. Many critics have described this as a refreshingly 'hopeful and pacifistic movie' making a 'a powerful case for communication over conflict'. I would like to think so - to be honest that was my immediate impression but it also occurs to me that there is another interpretation, what better way to assimilate another species/group than to get it to think like you do?! Much more effective than any Borg. Teaching them your language, and by extension, your 'reality', has often been the path taken by imperialists without any need for blood to be shed and wasteful conflict.

4.0,"Arrival is basically a combination of Contact and Signs.  It has the atmosphere and feel of Signs and the story of Contact.  Though, I think it ends up being better than both those films.  This is mainly due to the ending.  Both Contact and Signs started out really interesting and engaging, but then started to lose it by the third act, and then the ending ruins it.  With Signs the ending was just lame; with Contact the ending was both lame and confusing.  With the amount of build-up this film gives us in the first and second acts the ending could have been a complete letdown just like those films were.  Thankfully, this film does not drop the ball on the ending, which makes Arrival a cut above the rest.  Despite that I would not call Arrival a phenomenon like most praise as.  It's definitely a good movie, but I was not blown away by it.
Like I said earlier, the story is very similar to contact where humanity finally has contact with alien visitors and the main character Louise, played by Amy Adams, is trying to find a way to decipher their language and communicate back to them.  The differences that, unlike Contact where the characters are deciphering a message and we never actually see the aliens, here the extraterrestrials actually come to Earth and the humans communicate with them directly, which makes the film more visually interesting.  
The film also has a very gloomy atmosphere to it, very much like Signs or a Christopher Nolan film.  If I did not know the director and people said Nolan directed this movie I would believe it, especially with the ending, which is something he would concoct.
The movie looks great in spite of the gloomy atmosphere.  The effects team did an amazing job with the visuals.  The score, while not the most memorable, also did its job at setting the mood of the scene.
The main thing about this film that prevents it from being a masterpiece for me is the characters.  Amy Adams is fine but the rest of the cast I thought was lacking.  The one thing Signs does better than this film and Contact, in my opinion, is the characters.  I was invested in Mel Gibson and his family more than the cast in Arrival and Contact.  You got good actors like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but their characters were rather bland.  Jeremy Renner's character felt rather pointless in the film until the very end when his role becomes clear.  Even so, the film does not make him a compelling character and his chemistry with Amy Adams felt a little forced.
Plus, while you understand their importance by the end, there are many scenes that drag and drag down the pacing a little.  Also, while the ending is good, there are a few scenes that feel odd or didn't really make sense with what the ending was going for, which I won't reveal to avoid spoilers.  That's more of a nitpick, but it bugs me.  
Overall, if you enjoyed Signs and/or Contact, or even aspects of those films you'll like Arrival.  If you like Interstellar, Inception, or just about anything directed by Christopher Nolan you'll enjoy Arrival.  I'd say it's definitely one of, if not the best alien invasion film to come out in a long time.  I didn't think it was spectacular like most did, but it's definitely solid.",Mitchell B,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 27, 2016",Mitchell B,/user/id/950134269,RT,950134269,

Well... far be it from me to criticize this ""intellectual"" movie or i might appear stupid. 
I'm going to anyway.
So I saw this squid on the jetty the other day and it squirted ink all over the place. Obviously it was trying to communicate with the people around it.Someone worked out that it was saying ""Please kill me""  and that was that.
I am totally flabbergasted that  a world of giant squids who squirt ink but have the vast and incredible technology to travel between worlds and/ or galaxies (or dimensions) do not have the basic understanding to COMMUNICATE with their intended destination.

You can imagine the conversation:  ""Shit! Something BAD is gonna happen and it involves those creatures on that little blue speck in that galaxy far far away (or parallel dimension or past time) and it's gonna affect US! Let's go and WARN them!""

""OK How are we going to TELL them?""

""Don't worry, They'll get the hang of it in no time""

Of course, there always happens to be a brilliant SINGLE person who can decipher the squid writing. And,of course, there's going to be a rogue group of soldiers who just want to blow it up because they are squids and they MUST be a threat cos they don't look like us. Hang the orders, who cares what the General says?

4.0,"So what can I say about Arrival that a hundred other critics and commentators have not already?  Arrival is a simple, straightforward science-fiction drama about a linguistics expert who is called in by the American military after alien vessels arrive and linger on twelve different locations around the globe.  She and a theoretical physicist must race against time to decode their language before the Chinese and Russian governments launch hostilities against the extraterrestrial presence.  Arrival is an attempt at hard science fiction and it mostly succeeds, as it is a brutally realistic portrayal of how our current civilization would react to first contact.  Furthermore, it's mostly a picture about thoughts and ideas, and to an even greater extent - human connection.  Amy Adams gives a tour de force that ranges from piquing our intellectual curiosity during key scenes to breaking our hearts as we follow her character on a roller coaster ride of emotional heartbreak.  Jeremy Renner plays well alongside her, and their methods of cracking the alien language proved as exciting as any action movie this year, for me at least.  Arrival does seem like other films in this genre such as Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but it manages to avoid being derivative or feeling like it was cannibalized from older entries in the genre.  No, Arrival carves out a unique place for itself and dares us to think just a little more about what lies beyond the horizon and about ourselves in equal measure.

5.0,"Denis Villeneuve delivers another flawless hit, and my personal favorite film of the year. Arrival explores themes of time, destiny, and communication; all under the unpretentious and non-schlocky guise of an alien invasion. Amy Adams once again owns this movie with a heart-wrenching performance. She's the current MVP in Hollywood and deserves every bit of praise for the range of emotions she brings to this role. Even the look of the aliens and their ships is something to behold. Despite the fact that the story is not really about them, Villeneuve and co really take their time to carefully create a memorable design.

Everything about the movie is minimalistic, understated, and nuanced - the performances, the score, the cinematography - which all serve to balance out the larger-than-life mystery on hand, which is a joy to watch unfold. Like all the best science fiction, the revelations contained within that mystery comment more on our internal lives and the human condition than they do about grandiose intellectual quandaries.

This is a film best seen knowing as little about it as possible. I will say that the film makes a pretty big ""ask"" of the audience, and I wasn't entirely ready to suspend disbelief as necessary.

Indeed. This is a self-indulgent, stereotypical film (""What?!? The military guys want to blow up the aliens first and ask questions later? Groundbreaking!!!"") built around a very weak punchline and Amy Adams' great talent. The punchline of Jodie Foster's "" Contact"" came to mind. After much machination and drama, Jodie ends up on a VR beach with an alien disguised as her dear departed Dad so she won't be frightened. She then is allowed to have a 5 minute interview about the Meaning of the Universe - sort of. When she asks why the aliens are communicating to humans in such a...well, she's too polite to say, ""in such a screwed-up manner!"" The alien responds, ""Because that's the way it has been done for billions and billions of years..."" Sort of like a bad authority figure saying, ""Because I said so, that's why!"" But the really sad part is that  the courageous, iconoclastic scientist played by Jodie just gazes longingly into the cosmos, surrounded by radio telescopes and smiling children.

4.5,Arrival is a film to launch a thousand conversations and pose a hundred questions. A seemingly straight forward science fiction film becomes a challenging think piece that is a provoking look at humanity and how we communicate. Like the best science fiction this superb film looks inward at humanity rather than outward at the skies. 12 mysterious spacecraft land on Earth causing alarm and panic. Two scientists are recruited to try and find ways of communicating. What unfolds will leave you spellbound and probably a little bewildered. As each scene unfolds we think we know a little more but there are twists and surprises that ultimately reveal much more than we first thought. After the sublime Sicario Denis Villeneuve shows he is a force to be reckoned with. His films combine sound and sight like few others.

Overall, it is a well made movie. I thought the writing, the acting, the direction, the performance was really good. I thought the sound effects, the music, the cinematography was amazing.

4.5,"Overall, I was very impressed with this film. I'd heard nothing but positives about it, and I can now fully concur with those reviews. It's not a casual film for sure. It requires concentration, memory and a willingness to process what is happening on the screen instead of simply witnessing it. It's also very deliberately paced, so don't expect to be excited at all times. The story draws us in by unfolding carefully and methodically, progressing unpredictably as we remain in the same state of apprehension as the characters. Amy Adams is fantastic in the lead role, the story told primarily from her bewildered but logical point of view. The supporting cast aren't slouching by any means, but with the central plot involving Adams and Renner interreacting with the visitors, nobody else, with the exception of the always awesome Forrest Whitaker, makes any real impact. It felt frustratingly confusing and muddled at times, but as the film progresses the reason for this becomes clear, as we realise that the central focus is not the aliens, but ourselves. I won't spoil what that means, I'll just say that the twist and conclusion are both very satisfying and it would be a sin to ruin them for you. Arrival is a definite must-see for any fan of Sci-Fi.

Communication is key to any civilisation talking to another. One would say that another higher civilisation would have some tech to overcome this problem however, this would probably not be the case so, the storyline is interesting, trying to decipher and understand how best to communicate. 

I thought the film was quite boring from the onset. That said, I like to see things with a little action. Would I recommend it to a friend? Probably not. Will there be an arrival 2? Well, that depends how the human race understands the encyclopedia of information offered from this alien race.

The writers, for some reason, decided that they wanted to throw subtlety out the window, and rather beat the audience to death with the big reveal for the last 15 minutes of the movie. Not only that, but they decide to take a huge lateral from sci-fi to romance, as if a crudely shoehorned romantic side-plot is ever a good thing, or even better if you just decide to use it to end the movie, rather than come up with a real ending.

5.0,"A wonderfully mysterious film with a non-linear timeline that still gives one enough cues to put it all together.

5.0,"""Arrival"" is a story of communication and language in an impossible circumstance.  Its unique science fiction setting might seem off-putting to a lot of viewers but this is truly a film that every moviegoer will enjoy.  I think that it is an easily relatable sci-fi movie because it does not take place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  The events of this film could take place today in our own backyard.  Moreover, this film appeals to our sense of realism through a scientific approach to language.  The story is driven by the concept of linguistic relativity which hypothesizes that the structure of a language shapes the way that we perceive the world around us.  Much like the language of the heptapods, the entire film is circular and in the end, we see all of the pieces of the story as a whole.  It also helps that these otherworldly, animal-like aliens are different than the humanoids that we have come to expect from alien movies.  There is no question that this will be the Oscar-winning, mind-bending science fiction hit of 2016.  A Best Actress nomination for Amy Adams is inevitable.  She boldly carries the entire film on her shoulders with intensity, several different dynamics of raw emotion, and convincing interaction with the CGI.  I love that her character approaches linguistic communication with a teaching methodology.  This further enhances the realism when compared with a film like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" in which a simple tonal language allows both sides to miraculously speak through music.  Jeremy Renner also turns in a nice performance through the chemistry that develops with Adams as the film progresses.  My main disappointment with the film is Forest Whitaker.  His presence in a film brings an expectation of great acting but his character is completely static and could have been played by any average actor, leaving me wondering why he signed on.  In spite of this small letdown, ""Arrival"" is a great film from top to bottom.  It answers all of the right questions to leave us satisfied but leaves enough questions unanswered to maintain the mystery.  Whether you are a fan of science fiction or not, ""Arrival"" is the movie that you need to see before Oscar Sunday.",Jonny P,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 25, 2016",Jonny P,/user/id/785357101,RT,785357101,

5.0,"Saw this again last night.  A phenomenal movie.  Full of Villenueve's slow, creepy pacing, symbolism, and profound themes about the nature of human life.  Absolutely marvelous flick.  Most intriguing was the introduction to the Sapir-Worf hypothesis that language frames perception; a hypothesis I first encountered through the letters of Tolkien.  Not only our manner of speech, but our ""language"" of images and signs contributes to how we perceive and what we are able to perceive.  If the hypothesis is true, and it certainly seems to ring true, movies themselves (and other visual imagery) constitute a language which can frame our perception as well.  Plato recognized this in the 5th century advising us to keep a guard on what artwork we took into ourselves since it changes who we are.  The movie is a perfect example of this hypothesis, embodying the very cyclic nature of the heptapods whilst telling a ripping good sci-fi story.

5.0,"Denis Villeneuve has proven himself numerous times in the past. What makes his movies so special is that he has a particular style that is so unique to him, that taking a look at a simple insert shot can give away exactly who directed the movie. Arrival is a lot like that. Villeneuve combines stylized shots with realism. This creates a look that suits Arrival flawlessly. However, the way the movie looks is merely the beginning. The performance of Amy Adams in this movie is extraordinary. The character is not only portrayed as it is to be expected, but we get to know the character better because of the subtlety in Adam's performance. Yet, the best part of the movie is not the acting either, it is the script. Arrival is a sci-fi movie, and yet manages to avoid clichés like Neo dodging bullets. The characters act like humans do, speak like humans would, have interactions like humans would and even have funny moments which feel personal.

I love that the lead is female but her soft voice, which critics claims draws audience in may only be our effort to hear her, especially over some of the sound affects.I found it often unclear if the sound effects were just the all to dominate mood setting sound track overlay or if they were supposed to be emanating from the spaceship or the aliens.

1.5,"Went to see this the other day based on the strength of the reviews.  What an incredible disappointment.  

The story line certainly has potential but for me, this movie is just one more example of film makers and Hollywood completely getting it wrong in their portrayal of the US Military to the point where I found the whole thing a big stinking pile of you know what.  As a Veteran, I was initially surprised at the way the military's role of being in charge of the situation was portrayed.  This would never happen in real life, but okay, poetic license and all that.  

But then they manage to check off every other negative stereotype from soldiers being mindless and blindly following orders to military spouses being irrational and crazy and then the finale of right wing talk radio causing right wing soldiers to conduct an act of domestic terrorism.  Because we all know if aliens landed on earth, the military would send the worst malcontents it could find to greet them.  But at least the movie has heroic college professors to offset the evil military types.  

They could have done a good job here, and I know they don't care that only 1% of the population might be offended, but this stuff is subtle propaganda and I'm just kind of tired of how it seems to permeate a lot of what shows up in our local movie theater.

4.0,"For the new sci-fi film Arrival, I felt that an unconventional review might be suitable considering that the movie is about communication. Therefore I sought out my pal Eric Muller to converse over the many qualities of this intelligent movie. Enjoy, dear reader.

General plot synopsis: a dozen mysterious alien ships hover above the ground across the globe. The government seeks out the assistance of Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), an expert linguist, to try and establish a communication line with the aliens and determine whether they are friend or foe.

---------

Nate Zoebl: So Eric, my good friend, let's talk about our first impressions of director Denis Villenueve's Arrival. I was really taken with just how cerebral it all was. Given the director's pedigree (I absolutely loved Sicario), I was expecting an intelligent movie that wouldn't follow the same blueprint as, say, Independence Day: Re-Something or Other Go Boom, but in many ways this movie feels like you're studying for the SATs. I don't mean that as an insult. It's a rather highbrow movie that follows a team of smart people doing something incredibly hard with a level of precision that brings an intense sense of realism to the scenario. It made me think of Arthur C. Clarke science fiction where if first contact were to happen it might go very much like this. It's a linguistics puzzle box and I found that to be fascinating. The movie delivers on that front. I'm sure the casual moviegoer will be bored by the lack of intensity for two acts of movie but I was delighted. You?

Eric Muller: My first thoughts were, ""Wow, Hollywood made a first contact movie that looks like how the real first contact would go."" Unlike other Hollywood blockbusters, this movie is patient. The focus of the movie is not the actors or special effects like other contact movies, the focus of Arrival is the script. The movie is a love letter to language and communication. The director did an amazing job of telling the story and also flipping conventional storytelling.

Nate Zoebl: We'll get into more of the flipping the script, so to speak, in our spoiler section but I heartily agree. I'll also admit that I feel much like Amy Adams as I await your next reply in this discussion (not to make any general comparisons to you and heptapod aliens). I think patience, as you cited, is one of the movie's greatest virtues. It takes its time, it naturally develops, and this is definitely evident in the first act. The step-by-step process of Adams and Jeremy Renner and the other scientists being escorted to the alien ship, suiting up, being told the hazards and unknowns, and going inside, experiencing the different gravity, and coming up close to the giant white wall that promised so much on the other side, it's teased out in a fashion that allows for anticipation to rack your nerves. The fear of what they're stepping into really settles in.

Eric Muller: I'm okay with being compared to a heptapod. I appreciated the movie taking its time, allowing the audience to learn and discover at the same time as Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. In other movies, learning the new language is usually done in a 15-minute montage. This movie is a Sci Fi movie dedicated to discovery, which is what science is.

Nate Zoebl: It's definitely a movie of discovery and I appreciated that it doesn't gloss over the challenges and details of that. It's also a discovery of our heroine, but again we'll save that discussion for a little bit. At its core, it's a movie about language and communication. How are we able to connect and interpret others? If 12 giant alien ships, which kind of looked like Pringles chips, were to one day appear randomly across the globe, how do we interpret intent? That's the movie's ticking clock, uncovering the intent of the seven-legged squid-like aliens before the more alarmist elements of our society give in to paranoia and destruction. How would an alien species even begin to try and have another understand its language? That's a fascinating starting point. I appreciated that the alien language was, indeed, alien. It's made up primarily of inky pictographs, circles with slight variations. This movie must have been nirvana for a calligrapher.

Eric Muller: There are going to be a lot of tattoos based on heptapod language. But you said it; the language barrier would be the first and hardest barrier to overcome in this situation. And there is one scene that really illustrates that point. When Forrest Whittaker asks Amy Adams why she is showing the aliens just simple words. Adams breaks down why the question ""What is your purpose here on Earth?"" is such a complicated question. Especially to anyone who doesn't understand English.

Nate Zoebl: I think that's such a smart scene because it opens up for us dumb-dumbs in the audience just how complicated language can be. He asks why teach them words and she says so that they have a vocabulary that they can answer back with. Arrival is kind of like the most intriguing ESL class you never took at the Learning Annex. What technical elements really stood out for you in the film?

Eric Muller: My favorite thing was them getting inside the spaceship. I know it was a simple camera trick with some CGI but it looked so good.

Nate Zoebl: Villenueve films are downright impeccable when it comes to their technical merits. Sicario was, top to bottom, a beautiful movie from looks to sounds to editing. The cinematography for Arrival was tremendous and really accentuated the overall eeriness. Also, the sound design deserves an Oscar. The sounds of the aliens as well as the disconcerting musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were best used sparingly. The aliens themselves worked best when they were somewhat shadowed, allowing our imaginations to go into overdrive to fill in the rest.

Eric Muller: Was it just me or did the aliens looks like the final form of the Elcor species from Mass Effect? For a budget of only 47 million, Arrival looks better than a lot of movies made with three times that budget.

Nate Zoebl: My question for you: was this central mystery enough for you before the pieces fell into place in the third act and the movie's larger end design was revealed? I think we're getting close to talking about all that good spoiler stuff, but before we do I wanted to know if the central drive was enough for you and in particular if the characters worked well enough. We're treated to a tragic series of flashbacks to provide some back-story to Adams, but I don't know if I'd say the movie presents much in the way of characterization until the third act (promise, we're getting there...). Hear me out, old friend: I almost think Renner's character is the typical ""girl"" part that Hollywood fills in these kind of larger movies, the co-lead which is really meant to support the main character and, typically his, journey of self-actualization or healing or whatever. I think there might be some subtle gender politics being subverted there or maybe I'm reading too much into an underwritten character.

Eric Muller: The central mystery was more than enough to keep me interested. As I noted earlier, we were discovering the events just like Any Adams. And you are right that this movie feels like if it had been made 10-15 years ago the genders for the two main leads would have been swapped. Probably have had Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.

Nate Zoebl: The natural sequel to The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down. I suppose it's here we should start getting into spoilers, so if anyone would like to remain pure, please come back later to read the rest of our conversation.

[WARNING: SPOILERS FROM HERE]

 
Nate Zoebl: It's a movie about language and our interpretation of language and I think, very cleverly, Villenueve and the screenwriter play with the language of film storytelling. We've been assuming from the start that these snippets of sense memories from Adams were of her tragic past. Au contraire my friend, they are revealed to be not flashbacks but flash-forwards to a future she has yet to live. Rust Cohle was right; time is a flat circle.

Eric Muller: This movie is a classic twist on a golden age Sci Fi story. Amy Adams' character arc could have been an episode of the Twilight Zone and been just as good.

Nate Zoebl: I think the filmmakers make something we've seen before, and frankly have become somewhat trite, and subvert it while making the movie and the central protagonist far more interesting. We've seen the tragic character that has to overcome the grief over the death of a child before, even recently in 2013's Gravity. We're primed for that kind of familiar Hollywood back-story to provide a dollop of depth to the main character. And then when the reveal comes, it makes the scenes have even more emotional power. Adams knew that she would have a daughter who would ultimately die as a teenager of some sort of awful disease, and Adams chooses to go ahead with this future fully knowing the unbearable pain that waits. This revelation instantly makes her character so much more interesting and puts the audience in her place to ask whether we would do the same.

Eric Muller: It is a great twist on a story we have seen before. Also it puts her in the position of whether she tells her husband about their daughter's future.

Nate Zoebl: And that philosophical divide is ultimately what dooms her marriage. Here's my choice, and I'll be interested if yours varies: I would have gone along with it too. Yes, knowing what is to come means that a child was brought into existence to die sadly as a teenager and will suffer, but she will also live and love and laugh for many days beforehand, and knowing the end provides a lens that incentivizes every moment spent together. Yes she will die eventually but any one of us could be snatched from the world at any moment. At least she got to know love and life for so many years before it was taken away from her. How would you choose in this scenario?

Eric Muller: I would let my wife know so we could enjoy every minute with our child.

Nate Zoebl: Let's step away from the emotional aspects. The end reveal also provides a jolt of energy to the climax because now it becomes a race against time, but time is also forward and backwards. Amy Adams has to stop the Chinese military from striking the alien ships and she has to use information from events that have not happened to save the day in the past. It's a heady moment of criss-crossing plot streams that really works.

Eric Muller: That reveal, that scene with Amy Adams with the Chinese general, was my favorite scene in the movie. The writing, the way it was shot, and the timing. The timing of that scene gave the audience a chance to breathe and fully take in the reveal.

Nate Zoebl: The scene reminded me of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, a film I wasn't that fond of beyond its second act planet-to-planet investigations. The screenwriter in me wants to criticize the use of the future to bail out the past because it feels a tad too easy. However, while it really irritated me in Interstellar (couldn't you be a bit more helpfully specific, Future People?!) I didn't have a problem with its use in Arrival. Maybe I'm a hypocrite but I feel like the execution is much more impactful here and it doesn't undo the plotting from before. It doesn't feel like a cheap trick. The heptapod aliens experience time as a circle rather than linearly, much like Dr. Manhattan crushing through the past, present, and future simultaneously. If we could see our future selves and the actions we make, and inform our current decision-making, I think that would probably bring about a rare world peace. Also, I really liked that the aliens weren't just these benevolent gifters but had an agenda as well because they know humans will save them thousands of years in the future. It's like they intervened so we could save ourselves.

Eric Muller: I also liked that the aliens said they will need us in 3,000 years. We never discover what the aliens need from us then. I think we went over this earlier, but Arrival is not a new story but just a great take and twist on that story.

Nate Zoebl: I liked that open-ended nature of the story. What if the aliens had come to Earth and spoke in nothing but emojis? Lots of pictures of eggplants and ""A-ok"" fingers and strangely anthropomorphic poop.

Eric Muller: Then we would use Amy Adams' soon-to-be-dead daughter to solve the mystery.

Nate Zoebl: The aliens would essentially be modern teenagers (I'll shake my old man fist at The Kids Today). The daughter would be all like, ""Whatever mom."" And then we'd all be dead. Though the ending reveal raises the question of fate versus free will. Can these future events and memories be prevented? I don't have an answer.

[END OF SPOILERS DISCUSSION]

Nate Zoebl: So Eric, what would you rate this movie?

Eric Muller: I have to go 5 out of 5 stars. One of the best movies I have seen this year. It was a better version of Contact. When you look at it versus Independence Day: Resurgence, it did everything right that ID4 2 failed at, like how you view Civil War versus BvS.

Nate Zoebl: Fair enough, though please don't ever bring up BvS in polite conversation without first giving me plenty of advance warning. I'm still working through that one. I think I'd rate it an ""A-"" myself, and I might change that in time. I think the only thing that held me back from a full ""A"" is that it saves the emotional investment a bit too late to have the full wallop I think it intended.

Amy Adams as Louise Banks in ARRIVAL by Paramount PicturesEric Muller: I think saving the emotional investment was the wise choice. Cause we get it to start with the investment and then the ending flipflops it.

Nate Zoebl: Now, on a scale of eggplant emojis, how many eggplants are you giving this movie?

Eric Muller: Is this where I admit I'm too old to understand emojis?

Nate Zoebl: I'll also admit that I don't understand the appeal, especially conversations that are nothing but emojis. Fittingly, I'll end this discussion with pictographs:

[Smiley face emoji + cat dancing emoji + little green alien with ""we're number one"" foam finger emoji + movie theater emoji + eggplant emoji + ""A-ok"" fingers emoji]

5.0,"""Arrival"" begins and ends with the song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" by Max Ritcher.  This amazing song is full of melancholy and sets the mood for what we might expect. Now this is a slow intense sci-fi thriller but underneath we have a beautiful human drama that isn't really felt until the end. It is clear that Denis Villeneuve made this film with close detail and the results are absolutely stellar. 
  The movie follows a linguist named Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to help in communication with the Arrival of an alien species who landed on earth. The movie focuses on Lousie Banks and an Astrophysics Ian (Jeremy Renner) as the go through sessions with the aliens and tries to find different technics to talk to them. During all of this, there is high tension between the countries on whether or not they should attack the aliens before they attack us. 
  This is the most realistic film about an alien invasion that I have ever seen. It shows the world in deep panic, riots break out and countries are unsure of what to do. The human race becomes spit and there is a lack of communication. Denis Villeneuve knows how to create tension to make this feel real. This movie is riddled with tension and the amazing score brings the eeriness to life. 
The visuals are beautiful with breathtaking scenes throughout. You can tell there are gonna be beautiful from the trailer but watching it on the big screen they really pop. The effects done on the aliens and their ships are also impressive. They are very detailed and their presence feels real. 
  Now let's talk about Amy Adams who is so good in this movie. Earlier this year she was in ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)"" which I really didn't like her character in that movie. In ""Arrival"" I was happy to see that she was extremely better. Her reactions and emotions are near perfect as this woman who going into the unknown.  Hawkeye was also good...I mean Jeremy Renner who's character isn't completely necessary in the movie but towards the end, his character becomes more apparent. Forest Whitaker was also good as Colonel Weber and it would be hard to imagine anyone else in that role. 
  The best thing about this movie is the level of intelligence at hand here. The various methods of communication and the way they handle it was thought provoking. The themes go further with  Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, language, and communication. Not just communication towards the aliens, but communication between us as humans. Of course since this also a Sci-Fi film there is also the theme of time and space. Towards the end, all these themes come together and we also get a twist that makes us think about the entire movie. 
  Now if you're going into this movie keep in mind this, not an action-packed alien invasion movie. No, this is more cerebral, more beautiful, and more emotional.  This move sits among great science fiction like ""Interstellar (2014)"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)"" but it also does well to stand on its own.

5.0,"Think more Solaris than Star Wars. Arrival is a melancholic science fiction film that feels like the art-house equivalent of Independence Day. For my money, Denis Villenueve has cemented his place within modern cinema. Denis is one of THE most exciting and innovative director who has emerged this century who has still yet to put a cinematic foot wrong. Arrival is no exception and is another welcome addition to his filmography. While Prisoners, Sicario and Enemy can all be considered thrillers to one degree or another, with Arrival, Villenueve tries his hand at the sci-fi genre to great success. Arrival in concept, premise and execution is everything that Christopher Nolan wanted Interstellar to be and more. Heady themes combined with rich humanity and strong characters, Arrival is one of the most interesting and surprising science fiction pieces I've seen in some time. I'm hesitant to explain story and concept as I feel this is certainly a film that should be seen going in blind but at the same time I believe this film might not be for everyone. Not to suggest the film is too smart for audiences and it isn't as bamboozling as anything like Primer or Upstream Colour but trading in blockbuster spectacle for intense dialogue driven plotting can very well be a turn off for some audiences. For me though, I never felt the film was dull because of the lack of conventional genre thrills as the film more than makes up for it in intensity, creativity and plot. In conclusion, I always knew Villenueve would deliver but I didn't anticipate how much I was going to think about this film and it's themes for a good while after viewing.

4.5,"Too often we see science fiction films, particularly involving aliens, that are only interested with how we, as a species, would fight back against them, usually with disaster results (the recent Independence Day sequel & The 5th Wave make a strong point on that). Adding to that, the trailer of this film offers absolutely nothing unaccustomed. At face value, it looks like a dubious 'Close Encounters' or a 'Contact' wannabe, with a threat of movement towards the likes of 'Independence Day'. Luckily, after watching it I can say this film is far from your average science-fiction thriller. From the cinematic brilliance of director Denis Villenueve who's proved himself as a stellar filmmaking talent in 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', and 'Sicario', comes an intelligent sci-fi piece that ditches the typical special-effects action extravagant tropes in favor for some thought-provoking conceptions, emotional jolts and a mesmerizing visual storytelling. Director Denis Villeneuve's film is science fiction at it's absolute deepest and most profound. It's a 'thinking mans' film that forces you to find your own interpretations. Sure to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Blade Runner, Children of Men and maybe even 2001: A Space Odyssey (a bit of a stretch) in the many years to come. The film uses its tagline ""Why are they here?"" quite literally to deliver one of the most fascinating films you will see all year. The story follows Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist who is grieving the loss of her young daughter, Hannah. Every morning, she arrives in the university to teach her regular class, but something is different about today. Wide scale panic is rising in the population as twelve alien space crafts have positioned themselves strategically around the world for unknown reasons. Due to her top secret clearance & her previous work with Homeland security, Banks is approached by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to lead a team and figure out a way to communicate with the aliens & find out where they come from & why are they here? Banks faces the biggest challenge of her academic career in trying to devise a strategy for communication without any foundation of knowledge on what level communication even works at for them. Assisted by Ian Donelly (Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist, the pair try to crack the code against a deadline set by the inexorable rise of tensions around the world. This film is a story about the power of communication, the illusory nature of time, and the importance of words and language in creating our conception of the world. Written by Eric Heisserer from the short story, 'Story of Your Life,' by author Ted Chiang, it is a thinking person's science fiction film that does more than offer bad guys threatening good guys. While its aliens are no great shakes in the looks department, here they have something akin to brains and are actually trying to teach us something which, given recent historical events, might be problematic. The does more than just provoke thought. It invites question, it craves understanding and most importantly it deserves dissecting, hopefully from someone who is a much smarter writer than I. I think the most interesting thing about this film is how it approaches the alien species. It's not your typical ""take over the world"" fiasco climaxing in an action packed third act. It's a slow, mesmerizing film focusing on the comprehending of language as a barrier of communication between different beings. Unlike Villeneuve's previous works, this film isn't a dark or twisted look at humanity. Instead, Villeneuve chooses to go for a lighter yet still serious tone with the mystery surrounding the arrival of the aliens. That is what makes this film so incredible, Villeneuve injects elements from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to make the story not only visual stunning but also makes it very captivating. the film does not rely on conflict between the humans and aliens to keep you invested and entertained because it remains against that trope. Each time our characters interact with the aliens, who remain covered in mist for most of the screen time, we as the audience gain something new in the form of knowledge and discovery rather then an action set piece. And when we return back to the outside world, we see through the media how each discovery affects it in different ways. What I really admire about Villeneuve as a filmmaker is the choice he makes to not spoon feed the audience with every single piece of information. He instead makes films to challenge the audience, leaving them to either complete the puzzle themselves or question the morality of his characters. Perhaps the strongest aspect here is how Dr. Banks' own personal story unfolds within the narrative. There's no scenes of bloated exposition so the audience can grasp what is happening, here Denis uses that to his strengths. We're not supposed to fully fathom the themes expressed as that would defeat their purpose. Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. It's the first massive-scale project we've seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centering on the human characters' efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is. Villeneuve has also proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, this film being no different. Bradford Young's (Selma, A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains. And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of the film was the score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, Jóhannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world. Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". So in case you are expecting some human vs alien action, you are in for the wrong film. Like his previous efforts, the film takes its own time to unfold, commanding your attention due to its slow pacing. Though the slow pace is enough to frustrate some film goers looking for something more exciting and less busy with high-classed ideas, there is no doubt that this makes for a remarkable experience. Amy Adams truly is the star of this film as she carries this film with a sense of gravitas but also vulnerability. She shows a woman who is at first terrified from meeting the newly arrived aliens but gains strength when she learns more. Flashbacks to a tragic event also reveal the struggle she goes through especially as the fate of the world is on her shoulders. Jeremy Renner does a good job as a physicist with a dry sense of humor. Forest Whittaker is also great a the general who isn't a trigger-happy idiot but someone whose job is just to get answers in order to find the safest and most humane solution possible. Michael Stuhlbarg is good.

4.0,"Thought provoking science-fiction has been in an upward swing as of late (with 2014s Interstellar and 2015s Ex Machina as recent examples) and director Denis Villeneuve continues the trend with his minimalist take on the ""aliens come down from space to earth"" story with 2016s Arrival, an emotional, poignant and rewarding take on such an old story setup. Less of an approach like Roland Emmerich would with something like 1996s Independence Day and more similar to M. Night Shamalan's 2002 film Signs, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (adapting the short story ""Story of Your Life"" from Ted Chiang) centers the story through a singular point of view as those unusual (alien) neighbors land in our collective backyards. Villeneuve made the wise decision in casting Amy Adams as our vessel and the success of the film partially rests on her shoulders (the supporting cast stand out as well, featuring Forrest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner). With great art direction that is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 1968 classic 2001: A Space Odyssey viewed through accomplished cinematography by Bradford Young, Arrival is a thinker and also has the looks to back it up (the score from Jóhann Jóhannsson is pleasing as well).

4.0,"Arrival was is a well crafted sci-fi puzzle that gives you all the pieces and respects you enough to let you put it together yourself. So much so that the group of friends I went with  discussed the film outside the theater, parsing through the plot and developing new levels of appreciation for the movie.

To honest I had low expectations going in and was very pleasantly surprised. I never saw the trailer. I hadn't seen Villenueve's other films but I found him a very competent director. I very much disliked Amy Adams in her previous role as Lois Lane but she did a great job here. 

The best part of the movie had to be the story and script. All the dense science and linguistic talk never got boring. The themes where consistent and well supported. And even though there is a very large plot present, it never sacrifices the smaller character driven plot around Amy Adams. In fact, under less talented writers/directors, this larger plot would easily have been the main focus and the ending more generic.

0.5,"Cerebrally horrible. I honestly don't get the user reviews. Boring and never delivers. Spent half the movies waiting for the dramatic reveal and the second half just wanting it to end. 

Spoilers:
This movie is a story about squid who have mastered gravity, flight, and physics but inexplicably are never able to figure out a human means of communicating.  This creates the need for Amy Adams character, an uninteresting linguist, to try to figure out there language. An eternity of skull f-ingly boring movie plays out with weird dream like interruptions. In the end the squid was just trying to teach us to master time to save them from what I can only imagine was some moderately interestingly horrible fate. The movie goes no further than that. Amy Adams however gets the ability to see at least her future and sees that she will have a child who gets a disease and dies a horrible death but chooses to have the kid anyway.  Clearly because of her ignorance or selfishness her baby daddy, hawkeye, leaves her.

1.0,"Apologies in advance for the stream-of-consciousness style of my review, and it will contain spoilers from the get-go. I understand that this movie could be refreshing to people who are bored by action-oriented science fiction films, and I'll be branded as a philistine for not being ""moved"" by the emotional scenes, but the pacing did a good job of defusing any real emotional pay off by showing the outcome without any real build up within the first five minutes. The twist ending where Amy Adams knows everything that will happen but proceeds anyway is so fundamentally irrational that it becomes unbelievable and raises numerous plot-breaking holes which would matter less if the plot had anything else to rely on. None of the characters' motivations were developed beyond the level at which they started the film, with the exception of Amy Adams who gains and wholly squanders the ability to predict the future. She doesn't take any steps to avoid the overwhelmingly negative outcome of her life after the events of the main plot. She doesn't seem to explain her newfound ability to Jeremy Renner, leading to their separation, even though given the circumstances he has no reason to doubt her. She also doesn't attempt to save her daughters life. Adams' emotional range in this film seems to start and end with this flat 1000-yard stare. Forest Whittaker's character doesn't learn anything. Jeremy Renner's character doesn't make any changes apart from the ones we knew he would based on the predictions within the film. Michael Stuhlbarg's character isn't developed. Why were low level military personnel allowed to acquire and plant such a quantity of explosives without anyone stopping them at any point and even asking what they were doing? Wouldn't the explosives need to be requisitioned? Are they just freely granted whenever anyone asks? Why were the aliens shown in a gas filled chamber from the mid-section down? Presumably as a cost-saving measure. Unfortunately, the film insisted on showing multiple close ups of the aliens mediocre CG. This could be overlooked if the aliens and their ship had a more visually interesting design. If there was a score, I can't recall a single note of it, having watched the film less than one hour ago.

4.5,"It's this year's best science-fiction movie with a brain.  So alien spaceships have arrived at seemingly random locations on Earth.  A linguist specialist (Amy Adams) has to figure out how exactly to communicate with them, and has to do it with the quickness before the patience of military forces expires to the point of them exploring more permanent options.  Now Arrival had a lot of steam behind it; it built a strong marketing campaign on its 100% rottentomatoes rating.  While that has since subsided to a 93%, this is still one of this year's very best, and it appeals to me as a critic, a science fiction lover, and just one who simply loves to be told an engrossing story.  This is not big budget science fiction (a $47 million budget is pocket change by Hollywood standards), and even though this is a polished and great looking film, this is really more of a thinking man's science fiction piece.  Yes, this is about aliens coming to Earth, but the film really sets itself apart by feeling grounded in reality; this seems like how the world would actually react to aliens just randomly showing up one day.  There would be a lot of scared people looking to their governments for leadership and direction, and if they weren't trying to quickly blow us to smithereens a la Independence Day, there would be hesitation and stalling as we try to figure out how to go about opening a dialogue between species, which is where Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) comes into play.  Amy Adams turns in some great work here, and it really is her movie to carry.  She plays a character that is efficient and competent at what she does, and the fact that she doesn't simply crumble with so much overwhelming responsibility being placed squarely on her shoulders makes for a compelling character that you can closely follow and root for.  This is not something that I would call slow paced, but it does take its time to set itself up and punctuate the moments that need the extra bit of attention.  The mystery of it all keeps you going, and you want to see what the next big discovery moment is going to be, and see if the countries around the globe can simply work together in a time of this much world panic.  It's a great original idea, and while there is a wonder to be had at these foreign beings coming to our planet, what really makes this so standout is the storytelling itself.  Not to give anything away, but this plays on the constructs of traditional narrative storytelling, so much so that I am actually really looking forward to the next time I get to watch this.  It has a conclusion that changes the way you look at the entire movie, and if you're looking for a movie that you can wholly invest yourself in its story, this is the one.",John M,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 22, 2016",John M,/user/id/782214838,RT,782214838,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/25106477/picture

4.5,"Dennis Villeneuve once against delivers a fantastically directed film. This time focusing on the Science Fiction and Mystery genres. It only takes the type of film within a genre to do something very different from any other film that's been made before. In saying so, 'Arrival' happens to be that type of film that succeeds in echoing familiar tropes of various Sci-Fi films though it is one of the most unique to date, due to it's incredible scripting and execution on film. The scripting is by far some of the best I've ever seen in a Sci-Fi mystery before, very character driven especially by Amy Adams linguist, primarily hired to communicate with the aliens abroad a large ominous ship. While Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', dealt with sound being a huge communication tool, 'Arrival' takes thing up a notch of using visual imagery to communicate with the alien species. The inner conflicts with the character's curiosities and concerns with the alien's intention is both fascinating and fully investing as that's the biggest strengths that come with the script, it also proves mystery is at it's highest when 'less is more' as well as 'show, don't tell'. Performances are also incredibly fine, with this being buzzed about a film that'll finally give Amy Adams the gold she deserves.

4.0,"Another alien invasion movie you say? Haven't we all seen this before? Close Encounters, Independence Day, War of the Worlds.. etc. They came from the heavens, and they either want to help us or take over the world. What's the big deal about Arrival. See it for yourselves, and look closer. Something utterly fascinating has been achieved by Denis Villeneuve, who is a now a three-time hit maker this maker. It's all about communication, and the meaning of life. A linguist goes through a journey of interpreting the peculiar written language of the alien creatures, which sort of resembles the Rorschach test. She discovers along the way that she can see into the future, and foretell what happens in her life long after the aliens leave.

The film is something to behold. Villeneuve does an incredible job directing once again, with outstanding cinematography by Bradford Young and a masterful score by the GREAT Johann Johannsson.

If you go into it with an open mind, it's not scary, doesn't have major comedic bits, gore, or Major Action. But it's tense. Oh so tense. (and good, oh so good!). Even RunPee cannot come up with a good pee time because the story has been cut to make it like a song. It starts slow, but with important scenes. Then crescendo's until you are in the main theme and engulfed by it. The Audience hums the theme of talk in the hallways out of the theater. Arrival's cinematography was also brilliant. That is why it is a must see in theaters. Even your 70"" TV will take a lot of emotion and beauty out of these great shots so go out and see it. I can't find anything wrong with the movie except that it leaves you wanting more. 4.6/5 Stars. It could have been bigger. But with the meager budget they had, a brilliant movie was made.

It also delivers some very interesting reflections on language and how it shapes our way of thinking and seeing the world. The photography of the movie was a little bit too dark for my taste, but it ends up working and the direction was pretty good, being able to maintain a level of intigue, tension, personal drama and realism throughout the whole movie. And, though it works pretty good, it is the level of realistic treatment that ultimatly plays against the movie's big revelation, which seems quite far fetched, even for a sci-fi movie of this type. Nontheless, that revelation leads to a very interesting and emotional plot twist, so I ended up liking it.

3.5,"From a technical side, this film is brilliant. The cinematography by Bradford Young is breathtaking. Each and every shot is crafted carefully and meticulously, and it seems each shot tops the last. Knowing that Young will be the DP on the Han Solo spin-off film, I was very curious to see what he brought to the table with Arrival, and he exceeded my expectations. This is a very slowly paced film, and that's not a bad thing. When done right, it can be incredibly effective. And I think it was effective-- for the most part. The problem is that the movie is so slowly paced for the first two acts, that the third act is rushed in order to have there be some sort of resolution, and because of this, a lot of things that are really important are glossed over...

The opening 'arrival' of the Heptopods is handled with suspense and subtlety and the final reveal of the monolithic lenses they fly in is spectacular. In fact, the cinematography on the whole is incredible.

The pacing, whilst not perfect, does a good job of setting up suspense and mystery as the intricacy of the story slow comes together as we follow Adams' characters initial bewilderment and fear change to comprehension and acceptable.

A worldwide approach and all, but all the aliens wanted was to speak to Amy Adams....? Through her daughter spirit? Well, Im open to suggest that this is not meant to be analysed in a straight forward matter, but on a more sub-conscious self-matter conflict. Amy Adams is devastated in grief after her daughter passing and her husband leaving.

3.5,"Arrival is the kind of major Hollywood movie some sci-fi fans have been eternally asking for. It's a story of alien vessels descending on Earth that doesn't present itself as an excuse to blow up the White House, or immediately turn into a cheap thrill ride. Its main focus is on something technical (linguistics), and it doesn't immediately turn into faux-mathy quantum-this relativity-that technobabble but instead lets it drive the plot. It involves nations colluding and high stakes, yes, but it also is consistently a very personal story that never loses sight of its main character. It leaves plenty of room for imagination while not resorting to magical excuses. But something's still missing for me. Arrival is a sparse, thoughtful, beautiful film that I just can't love, mostly because it's payoff simply didn't entirely work for me. To go on much further would be clearly spoiler territory, but suffice to say that the movie doesn't cheat with any twists nor does it betray its tone. In fact, its payoff is incredibly affecting dramatically. While the viewer in me interested in human stories left satisfied, the world-investigating nerd in me felt a bit let down.

Arrival's sparsity and humanistic elements come to the forefront immediately, starting with flashback's to Dr. Louise Banks' (Amy Adams) daughter dying young, and allowing the landing of the aliens to happen entirely offscreen. We only see what Dr. Banks sees, and only get a full-out effects shot once she's brought in by the military as a linguistics expert. Twelve crafts have landed sporadically around the world, and while Dr. Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) try to figure out just what they want, they must work with the other eleven nations while also staving off aggression towards the visitors both foreign and on their base. It's timely that international mistrust plays such a large role here, considering the current nationalistic trend in politics, but Arrival mostly shies away from that form of commentary. It has more sympathy for the aliens themselves, and condemns those who see mystery and respond with fear. Alt-right-esque commentators make brief unsavory appearances, panic spreads through a literal game of telephone, and when Renner notes that they're having ""Coffee with some aliens"", it's possible to mishear as something very politically relevant today.

For all that it has to say about how we treat those deemed ""other"", Arrival is more interested in it's sci-fi elements than its political ones. And while they don't entirely land for me, they take big swings and hit home emotionally. A lot of it's successes have to do with its score, beautifully subdued and often incredibly sad, and Villeneuve's command of mood, painting the movie in a washed-out blue haze on Earth and surgically cold blacks and whites on the vessel. Its alien design is fairly minimalistic, with the gravity-bending trick seen in the trailers as its lone flashy moment. Otherwise, it's content with its giant black obelisks of vessels, remarkable for their unremarkability. Amy Adams gives a career-best performance in the middle of a fantastic career, important as the movie rests entirely on her shoulders. No amount of disappointment in the end result can erase the fantastic buildup, and if you're able to go with it all the way, the reward is memorable and touching.",John D,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Nov 20, 2016",John D,/user/id/217342012,RT,217342012,

His careful and steady approach to pacing and suspense is unparalleled in modern cinema. He clearly draws inspiration from movies like Interstellar, and even a hint of Inception at the end.

4.0,"Arrival is labelled intelligent science fiction, but is really more of a thoughtful and thought provoking film that lives under the shadow of 2001: A Space Odyssey; Close Encounters of the Third Kind; and Contact. Aliens have arrived on Earth via 12 gigantic hovering contact lenses and we have to figure out whether they are friend or foe. In attempting to communicate with them, the film playfully explores the concepts of both linguistic and cinematic language. Denis Villeneuve's assured direction and a stylish production design makes the film feels particularly original and visually eye-catching. Amy Adams' character is relatable and her nuanced central performance anchors the film while Johan Johansson's soundscape of a score creates an atmospheric space for the film and the audience to feel and resonate with the emotive gravity of the storyline. However, this film is front and foremost an exercise in immaculately executed storytelling. Granted, the first third of the film, at first, feels slow and lumbering but it is to the film's credit, that once you have experienced it as a whole, that first third's existence is totally justified and more. Seemingly throwaway scenes and dialogue become more relevant and their significance revealed once the whole picture is presented and it is one doozy of a reveal that is well worth the 2 hours the film takes to get to.

2.5,"'Arrival' easily hooked me in, because it deals inventively with some big questions.  What would it be like if alien life came to earth?  Would be able to communicate with it?  What challenges would we have?  What fundamental differences would exist between people and aliens?

The movie was provocative and discussion stimulating, but ultimately had some plot flaws that caused it to fail, in some respects, to live up to its considerable promise.  In particular, there was a subplot throughout the film that, though it nominally served a story related purpose, felt like a stitched-on afterthought.

It's a movie that offers a blend of modern digital scenery with an honest portrayal of how the world might actually behave if aliens visited our planet. For that - it felt very real and that wall of impossibility that you normally place in your head while watching other alien movies is not as noticeable because you are much more invested in the characters than you are the aliens. Amy Adam's character is by far the most intruiging and the script requires her to tap into almost every human emotion. Given the weight of her character the success of the film truly depended on her performance and without question she delivered. As it turns out, the movie is less about the reason the aliens are there and more about the power of communcation.  This film is really about striving to find lifes prescious moments and never taking them for granted even if they are wrapped up in an otherwise painful experience. The billiance of the film is that the message is delivered to the audience rather subtly and it becomes more powerful the longer you reflect on the scenes themeslevs. Overall a must see movie and my favorite in 2016.",Alex N,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 19, 2016",Alex N,/user/id/972865939,RT,972865939,

Great story, legendary storytelling (Dennis is better than Nolan in my eyes :O) It celebrates what is best about sci-fi...the sense of wonder, of making you curious, thinking deeper about what it means to be human.

It's not the typical special-effects-laden sci-fi movie. It doesn't have countless explosions or gunfights so I can understand some of the reviewers labeling it as ""boring"". This movie is kind of a marriage between 2000's Memento and 2009's Moon, where the primary plot of the movie is secondary to figuring out what exactly is happening and, of course, the big reveal in the end only leads you to question again what you just watched.

I would say the movie is a contender for cinematography (it's gorgeous) and possibly adapted screenplay, and the acting is pretty good.

2.0,"Promising plot that fails to deliver.

I'll try to write this without spoilers and explain why I thought this film was an astronomical let down. If you're like me and you believe the success of a film hinges drastically on the ending (Ive found that a poor film can become a great one with a solid ending, just as a great film can become a poor one with a bad ending) then expect to be let down by ""Arrival"". 

Firstly, there is little doubt ""Arrival"" will get its hooks into you and most likely entertain and intrigue the hell out of you throughout (which is why I gave it two stars instead of one) but because the ending is so abrupt and the subsequent discovery of the premise is so obvious and disappointing it's hard to imagine anyone leaving the theater satisfied. If you don't care much for a premise, and endings don't effect your opinion on the quality of a film then stop reading this and go see it. you won't be disappointed. But if those things are important to you then read on.

I went with a large group and afterwards half of us gave it two thumbs down (including myself) while the other half gave it two thumbs up. I think it's interesting there was no one in the middle, we either hated it, or loved it. What's more interesting, is after I explained my thoughts (mainly concerning the failed ending) the half that enjoyed the film all decided to change their opinion.

As I said the movie does a great job (better than most) of entertaining you and pulling you in so you're intrigued, engaged and excitedly waiting for the story line to take off. And that's where it will leave you.

The premise of the movie is humans are incapable of working together and achieving unity without the assistance of a third party (aliens in this case), and without that unity we are destined to destroy ourselves and each other. Why do the aliens care? Because in 3000 years we save them, it doesn't go any deeper into the ""why"" than that... So in order to unite the human race the aliens travel back in time to give the leading nations 12 different pieces of a complex puzzle, all in the hope that we work together to solve the puzzle and achieve global unity. If that sounds like a bunch of BS then you'll feel the way I did.

Simply put, ""Arrival"" was created to profit off of humanities current shortcomings, mainly our inability to unite. In a world with unity concerts and a Trump/Hillary presidential ticket it's surprising Hollywood hasn't done a cash grab project to profit off of this topic sooner as they often do with sensitive topics relating to race, religion and politics. The worst part of the film is that this is all very obvious to the audience after only 20 minutes of the story. You'll spend the next 90 minutes thinking and expecting that there is going to be more depth than this, but there's not. You'll assume something, anything, is going to happen (like a war suddenly breaks out between humanity and the aliens) yet nothing does. There is no plot twist, no left turns, no right turns, no passing go and no collecting 200 dollars... And when they finally get around to spelling out the above premise, that's it, It's over! Exactly when you think something is finally going to happen, the credits start to roll.

In summary, this movie is anti-climatic and leaves you wanting, waiting and expecting more in the worst way possible. The strong acting and intriguing plot draws you in, but fails to take you anywhere. Almost as if the creators had plans of grandeur when they started production but ran out of money and just decided to call it a day. I recommend saving your money and renting this one. If you still want to go see a movie then I suggest Fantastic Beasts or Hacksaw Ridge.. at least in those you'll enjoy a great plot throughout along with a strong ending.

1.5,"Short version:
Don't see it, unless you want to walk out about half way through. Leave at the explosion. You'll know it when you see it.

Long version:
This film is like going to dinner at an expensive restaurant that you recently heard of; Everyone said it was very good. You sit down, and enjoy some very nice appetizers, then start enjoying a very delicious main course. When you're half done with it, the waiter snatches your plate away, and gives you your dessert. Confused, you look down to see some angel food cake. You think this is strange, and also a bit boring, since it's just sponge cake, without any garnish, or even icing. You take a bite, and realize that they mixed up the sugar with the salt. It's not even poisonous or terrible-tasting, because the recipe wouldn't call for very much sugar in the first place. You didn't go to the hospital, but you still left with a bad taste in your mouth, spoiling the previously-enjoyed parts of your evening.

(SPOILERS from here on.)
This film wasted its entire premise, budget, and actors on two acts that seem to be setting up for something interesting, but end in deus ex machina. The main character literally solves the world's problems in the third act with outer-space time-travel magic. If you think about it after seeing the film, the nations and peoples of the world are probably *more* war-like, and distrustful of each other, because now they have magic time-travel technology to fight over. Nobody overcomes their past. Nobody grows as a character.

5.0,"This movie can only be described as something that starts out with a very simple idea and ends up turning into a complex and exciting story. Arrival is a truly sci-fi movie that you watch with your mouth open in amazement that gets better by the minute with an unforgettable and unpredictable ending.  

Arrival begins when 12 UFOs touch down in random places on Earth. The whole world is panicking and the United States looks to a talented linguist named Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and a gifted Theoretical Physicist named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate what the aliens really want from us and what their purpose on Earth is. Once the new team starts uncovering the information about the mysterious species, they find very surprising things that go against everything we once knew. 

The movie is great overall but the ending is what really makes Arrival so legendary. The special effects are spectacular and the acting is extraordinary. Amy Adams excels in her role of Dr. Banks. What I most liked about the movie is how it all comes together. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending is mysterious and can be interpreted in hundreds of different ways depending on what angle you look at it from. The only other movies that have such perfect endings and make you actually think deeply about  what exactly is happening are Interstellar and Inception. Another thing about this film that blew me away is the cinematography. From giant aerial shots of 1500 foot UFOs to a fleet of battleships about to start an attack, the cinematography truly adds to the intensity and amazement of the film. My one small criticism has to do with the last few minutes. The creators stretch it out about five minutes too long in their attempt to show in very deep detail what exactly happens at the end. I feel like they could have shortened it and explained the ending instead of stretching it out, but that only lasts a couple of minutes and is hardly noticeable. Another huge perk is the sound editing and the soundtrack. The sounds of the UFOs and the aliens are intense and the music perfectly suits the story. This combination makes your heart thump and works wonders with surround sound. 

My favorite scene is when the aliens first start writing in their language. They write using something that resembles ink that stays in the air. It is truly beautiful and unique. It is unlike anything else I've ever seen before in a sci-fi movie with aliens. I also like this scene because it is when they start talking about their language and how they talk backward and forward at the same time. If they think like this, they can write and create a complex sentence in a split of a second, which amazed me. I also admired how the story treats their language almost like an art form and not just a way of communication.

There is a presence of some mature language in a few scenes as well as very intense and dramatic moments, so I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars despite one small hiccup because of just how it makes you think about life and the future and gets your adrenaline pumping.

5.0,"There's nothing scarier than the unknown, yet the unknown is the only sure thing. All that's real is what has already arrived; luckily, the truth of love can never fully depart. Though time causes the pain of endings, the love we experience is always worth it. 
What does all this have to do with alien-invasion-drama Arrival? Everything. A visually mesmerizing, aurally overwhelming, emotionally disruptive, narratively surprising, and thematically pulsing sci-fi film for the ages, it's not to be missed.
The setup is familiar: a group of UFOs appear over different cities all over Earth, and a small group of disparate humans must lead all humanity towards an understanding of their purpose. However, Independence Day this is not. More suspenseful than thrilling, it's high-minded science fiction whose slow and steady pace only emboldens its immense engagement. 
Think the best aspects of Kubrick and Spielberg: brainy ideas and complex visuals, mixed with spectacle and humanism. For example, on first entering the alien ship, we experience: characters' shifting sense of gravity, fear giving way to wonder then back again, the prescient difficulty of communicating across impossible boundaries. Villeneuve, who's becoming one of the greatest directors of our time, embodies such meaning into each of these moments. Even lines like, ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you,"" carry meaning beyond their clichés. 
Its intelligent sci-fi style brought to mind Close Encounters, Tree of Life, Interstellar, and fourth film I won't mention. Just know that time and awareness are huge throughout, leading to a final montage that brought me to tears for the first time this cinematic year.

5.0,"Arrival - 5/5

Another great film from Denis Villeneuve. Beautifully shot and masterfully acted by Amy Adams, it's truly one of the best films of the year 2016. 

Actually I had to watch it twice to make sure how I'm feeling about the film. The first act deals with the context it's written in very realistically and the second act felt and certainly looked very Terrence Malick-y. I just have to compare some aspects of the film to Malick's The Tree of Life. Perhaps he's one of Denis Villeneuve's inspirations or it's just me.

The overall look of the film is stunning, as with most of Denis Villeneuve's films. Bradford Young, the first African-American to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, made the film look real more so than real life. His shot compositions are stunning and the use of light, natural and effects, is great. He's worked on Selma before and I'm excited to see his work on the upcoming Han Solo film. 

As with most of his previous works, Jóhann Jóhansson does a great job with the score of the film. Almost seamless at times, it's difficult to differentiate if it's being played with the film or just in my head as I'm watching this beautifully shot and told film. I guess that seamlessness and the at times abundant music is also what makes Arrival a great film. He's also writing the score of Deni Villeneuve's upcoming Blade Runner 2049, which is another great reason to look forward to the long-awaited sequel.

On The Hollywood Reporter's Roundtables Amy Adams said that the first thing Villeneuve told her about the film was that it's a mother's story. A story about a mother. How true that is. But that's not to leave the questions that were asked and the messages we have to decode from the film. 

Hard to say if I have any criticism about the film, but if I had to nitpick, I'd say the film's first act is a bit of a slow burn but that's expected of Denis Villeneuve's films. So I guess that's that. 

Overall I recommend you to watch this film and hopefully it will spark some great conversations with your friends and peers.",Rusty R,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 18, 2016",Rusty R,/user/id/901971706,RT,901971706,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1116476272/picture

3.5,"As a painting this could hang in New York's Metropolitan Museum, or the Louvre in Paris. Beautifully crafted throughout by director Denis Villeneuve, who had impressed with Sicario last year, this is a triumph for his skills and for those appearing in front of the camera - none more so than Amy Adams, who embraces her role with the gusto of someone on the Oscar trail. After five nominations so far, this could be her year. 
No painting, as a film this falls slightly short for me, but that view is not echoed by all and I applaud those that appreciate such a work of obvious good intent. My problem was that, having been promised a film that would rock me on my heels, I was always waiting for something to happen. The pace is pedestrian but spooky. Gradually, as the clock in the dark of the theatre ticks by, it becomes clear that options for the ending are limited. On our journey we see mankind exhausting its usual stupidity (thinking creatures that have traversed a universe in a way we can only contemplate will be thwarted by tanks and missiles was surely poorly considered) until staring ineviatibilty in the face. And through the haze on set, I was not entirely convinced by the aliens, feeling that beings with an octopian shape would have a logistical  difficulty in building the machines they had arrived on, and wondering how a society could be built on their methods of communication. 
Perhaps I was taking it all too seriously. Perhaps I entered the cinema with too many expectations. To be fair, this is worth seeing but I don't feel it is the masterpiece that it has been labelled.

3.0,"Arrival: spoiler alerts are not necessary to review this movie.  No amount of description can dull the shock and surprise you'll feel seeing stale Hollywood formulas like this paraded around anew, albeit with the obligatory gazillions of dollars worth of big budget special effects.  But don't turn away yet.  I'll give Arrival a three out of four overall, for its eerie overcast ambience and especially for Amy Adams, but 2.5 out of four for sticking to trite ""aliens visit earth"" plot lines.  If the soundtrack alone doesn't evoke a very long trailer for all the sci-fi thrillers you've ever seen, you haven't seen enough movies. 

Our heroes, smart science nerds, are pitted against the usual suspect bad guys: trigger happy marines and creepy Henry-Kissinger-esque national security spooks.  There's even a little - Surprise!! - romance and some mildly interesting but basically barroom scientific theorizing thrown into the mix.   The overriding theme of Arrival is its gloomy, overcast ambiance of big bad things, waiting to happen, against slate-grey Montana skies, punctuated by the thunderous flatulence of the horn section in the soundtrack.

I didn't know I'd get a woman as a main character and that she would be highly skilled and respected for it and never really have to fight to prove herself. The details of the film felt really rich -- the shape of the language they use to communicate with, the way the mathematics of language is explained to the audience -- clear without being overwhelming. I straight up liked it. What stuck with me is this idea about knowing, or more specifically, about women's knowledge. The heaviness of certain truths sits with women in a way they never will on the men around them. I'm not going to break this down to patriarchal gender roles and conditioning or to the fact that women live in a society that oppresses them while they are often in romantic relationships with their oppressors. I'm not going to link this theme to the natural conflict that arises there, or to the need women naturally have to keep a part of themselves and their knowledge and experience of the world seperate from the men who are closest to them. Because the film doesn't make that link. The film has aliens to explain for the conflict.

4.5,"Arrival is directed by Dennis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, a language expert teaching at a university who is called upon by the U.S. government to establish communication with a mysterious alien race that makes contact on Earth. She is helped by another scientist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner).

I almost hesitate to write this review because there's so much to dissect with this movie that it almost requires multiple viewings to completely understand. Without giving anything away, I will say that Arrival is a brilliantly effective piece of Science-Fiction due to Amy Adams' performance and really powerful themes of understanding other cultures' points of view. While the pacing is slow throughout, the payoff is strong enough to forgive any lags. I was really drawn in during the middle act of the film when Adams and Renner were beginning to learn the alien language. The emotions of those scenes were incredibly palpable, and I caught myself grinning along with the characters when they made a breakthrough.

The ending of this movie is why I feel Arrival needs to be watched multiple times. Certain facts are made known, making the (somewhat) obvious twist ending much more complex than it seems. It reminds me of the ending of Inception in how ambiguous it felt once the credits rolled.

In the end, Arrival is a powerful movie and proof that big-budget films can still occasionally contain original content. Be ready for a thought-provoking movie and not an action flick, though. Ok, I'm going to go watch this again.

5.0,"From all of the excellent reviews and the enthralling trailers, I had
incredibly high expectations for the movie Arrival as I was walking
into my local theater. I left the theater almost on the verge of a
panic attack with my expectations obliterated after the movie ended.
Arrival was the most breathtaking and powerful films that I have ever
seen, and I can honestly say that I have never had so strong of a
reaction to a movie in my entire life. From the heartfelt cold open, to
the appearance of ""Arrival"" signaling the ending of the movie, I
believe that it was as close as a film can come to being perfect. The
emotional perfection of the movie's climax was almost too much for me
to handle, and it brought out a reaction in myself that I've only
experienced when reading books (mainly from Robin Hobb and Patrick
Rothfuss).

It was a joy to see a true Hard Science-Fiction story on the big
screen, and Denis Villeneuve has proved once again to be a masterful
director. Every frame of this film is incredibly gorgeous, and I honestly don't know how some of it was filmed, as things that have to be CGI look so real. There is so much I could say about the movie, but I want to avoid any chance of spoilers. However, I will say that the design of the aliens and their language was incredibly interesting, original, and beautiful. I loved how the creators of the movie embraced the fact that if we do ever meet any alien species, they are not going to look anything like us or immediately be able to communicate with Humanity. It's very interesting how the movie handles deciphering the Heptapod's language and teaching them our language, and while some could find these moments boring, for me they were engrossing. I wouldn't have minded even more scientific examination of linguistics and translating the language that bears no resemblance to anything created on Earth.

This movie may not be for everyone, but depending on how it holds up
after multiple viewings, I might have a new movie in my personal Top 10
Films of All Time. I highly recommend it, and if you want to see a

My, there have been some turkeys over the last couple of decades... 2010zzzz, Star-grate, non-Event Horizon, Promethaneous, Star Wars teh Phantom Plot.. I could go on.
Suffice to say this is not one of them.
You know that delicious feeling when you're in a cinema with an audience that is really gripped? So rare in these days of zero-attention spans... in the silent moments you could hear a pin drop... on a carpet.
Lots of shudders and silent' aaahs' too. You just know when people are collectively enjoying a movie and this is one of those movies and for a sci-fi flick that's exceptional.
The plot and the action are almost but not quite secondary to the beautiful and atmospheric way it is displayed and arranged... I have rarely seen a film that took so much pride in its identity and execution. The performances are top drawer and the casting near-perfect.
Some might balk at one or two lame lines towards the end but for me they just added a little light relief to a quite heavy story and can be more than forgiven.
As many others have pointed out, this is a cerebral film as much as anything. You're not just along for a flash-bang-wallop ride, this one makes you think right until the end.

There is not much story, it's basically a group of military personnel (lead by Forest Whitaker) that recruits Adams and Renner to try and communicate with the aliens to find out why that are on earth and if they are hostel.

Each country shares the information they obtain from studying the Aliens until one word is translated and one by one they cut off contact with each other.

3.0,"""Arrival"" is going to be either a clear-cut hit or miss for moviegoers, with passionate sci-fi enthusiasts more likely to place this film in the former category. Others will scratch their heads leaving the theater and rhetorically ask themselves ""Can I have those two hours of my life back?"" But few partakers of ""Arrival"" will put it into the middle-ground of mediocre.  It's a go big or go home formula for this edgy mind-bender.  The latest film by Denis Villeneuve (who directed last year's phenomenal ""Sicario""), ""Arrival"" explores an alien vs. human showdown over Montana, as a dozen spaceship pods (or ""shells"") arrive unannounced in parts of the world. 

Viewers are cautioned to approach ""Arrival"" with the same mental acuity as a straight-A student sitting down to take their high school SAT test.  Serious cognitive stories require serious concentration to decipher linguistic relativity and its relative effect on a person's world views.  
The concept that thoughts are determined by language comes across like a philosophy lecture back in our college days.  And one's skillful ability to finish a BFF's sentence in mid-conversation is not nearly enough moxie to fully understand or apply the film's scientific theories.  Simply put, one must focus intently on the notion of linear time and how one would approach life if they knew how it all played out beforehand.  

Director Villeneuve orchestrates confusing mental gymnastics upon the audience, combining a stale present day storyline with a barrage of visual ""flashbacks"" into Amy Adam's Louise Banks character. Banks, a college Linguistics professor, is asked by the U.S. military (an Army Colonel portrayed by Forest Whitaker) to direct first contact negotiations with a pair of these squid-like creatures. 

The film begins with a plausible and well-developed alien arrival to Earth.  Between the mass hysteria and ""Breaking News"" mantras from the media worldwide, a gritty global response is initiated-only to be noticeably forgotten.  Boredom ensues when the film's trail of crumbs into the aliens is stopped to prolong the razor-thin, repetitive memories revealed from Louise's life role as mother and wife. 

Villeneuve's slight-of-hand filmmaking technique is both confusing to follow and too time consuming for many to care about by the last scene--wasting the movie's solid opening and top-shelf cast.  Faithful viewers are conspicuously kept in the dark until the film's anticlimactic and lackluster ending.

""Arrival"" tries too hard to elicit a sci-fi equivalent to the shocking mind game from the movie classic ""The Sixth Sense"".  After a promising start, the movie slows to a cephalopod-writing pace and clumsily tests viewers' patience beyond what most humans should endure at a theater.  Despite having Oscar-winner Whitaker and over a half-dozen Academy Award nominations between Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, the trio's sensational acting skills are not given roles to truly shine. 

Stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and indulge in your favorite Starbucks drink before catching this far-out alien head-fake.

5.0,"Arrival is one of those personal movies for me. A thought expression, an idea that has always been on the tip of your mind but you've never quite been able to root out, brush the dust off of, and stare at clearly in the sunlight. Arrival is why the science fiction genre is important; it is why society needs such types of contemplative escapism. Science fiction allows society to observe and consider a narrative in abstract of reality. It allows for humanity to entertain and present ideas as entertainment in a non-threatening manner so as to suggest--in so doing--a reality which the world is not yet ready to acknowledge. With this movie director Denis Villeneuve has cemented himself among the ranks of the greatest to ever champion the science fiction genre. Bring a worthy adaptation of Ted Chiang short story. This movie, in my not so humble opinion, ranks clearly up there with '2001: A Space Odyssey as timeless and seminal works of the science fiction cinematic landscape; more specifically: a work dealing with a higher power and humanities context in the universe

By:Clem The Movie Guy.

Based on Ted Chiang's short story, Story of Your Life, Arrival stars Amy Adams as Dr. Louis Banks, a linguist expert recruited by US Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to be part of a team that also includes mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) working to establish communication with the mysterious cephalopod beings who have landed their twelve spaceships in various locations around the world. When verbal communication proves impossible, Dr. Banks discovers that a visual language is the key to understanding the alien's purpose. However, meaning in language can be mutable & there is the addition complication that each of the ships may be communicating only one aspect of aliens' intentions, requiring cooperation from the different countries hosting alien vessels. During the intense process of discovery, Dr. Banks is having some unsettling dreams that seem to be an essential element of understanding the alien communication. Directed by Denis Villeneuve from the screenplay by Eric Heisserer, Arrival is a thought provoking & beautifully compelling sci-fi drama with a stunning ending that left me wanting to see it again. Amy Adams gives an out-standing performance that is worthy of Oscar nomination. I also appreciated seeing a different type of alien represented.

5.0,"When twelve gigantic objects arrive from space and position themselves randomly over various points on the Earth, there is naturally a scramble to try to find out where they came from and what they want. Amy Adams plays linguist Louise Banks who is called on by the American military to try to communicate with the alien occupants of the ships. We share nothing in common with these aliens and despite the best efforts of Banks and the team she is working with, progress at understanding the creatures is painfully slow and incremental. Added to this, Dr. Banks is dealing with her own, personal tragedy and is seemingly bothered by flashbacks to various periods of her life. This is a thoughtful and thought provoking movie that is not so much about how we might cope with an alien visitation, rather it concerns itself with what it means to communicate and how we come to terms with difficult decisions which can have profound consequences. I really became engrossed in this wonderful story in which Adams is simply sublime. Her portrayal was well-observed and hugely affecting, evoking in me a real sense of sympathy. You can really sense her frustration at the task she is facing and I was really willing her to succeed. Jeremy Renner takes the role of scientist Ian Donnelly and is a quietly understated and totally appropriate supporting character and it is refreshing to have such a big movie, fronted by a pair of sympathetically played experts. There's no melodrama, no sensationalism and no dumbing-down. This feels like a real investigation of a genuine mystery which has an unusual and upbeat message. The look of the aliens is convincingly realised and their ships, simply hovering in the air, are an impressive sight. There's a wonderful and non-intrusive score that compliments the on-screen action perfectly and helps add to and maintain the atmospheric mystery that slowly unfolds. I'm not familiar with the work of director Denis Villeneuve but on the strength of this movie, I'd certainly like to catch some of his previous movies and I am quite excited to learn he is in the directors chair for the upcoming Blade Runner sequel.

4.0,"amazing movie, very intriguing and interesting throughout. very powerful and moving. beautifully shot.. great directing


SPOILERS


i was worried this movie would have a vague abstract ending open to interpretation. when they started showing the play dough alien and her teaching the language i started getting so confused, wondering if it was time travel and she was affecting the past. then, in one climactic moment, the reveal. i went from not know wth was going on to understanding everything perfectly. the twist brought me to tears from how awesome it was. everything made sense at that moment. and it was a more perfect and satisfying conclusion than anything i would have come up with. and as with all great twists, they tell you the twist early in the movie, when they said something like ""i thought this was the beginning, but they see time differently than us""

this movie also has a lot you can discuss afterwards. like the reason she got divorced (presumably because she told him their daughter would die and he was upset that she didn't tell him beforehand because he wouldn't have gone through with it). and the concept that the language is circular, and it doesn't matter if you read it forwards or backwards. that parallels her ability to now see time differently, not linearly. it also relates to the daughter's name being a palindrome. hannahannahannah. 

She got married and had a baby knowing she would get divorced and lose the baby. I think that's the difference with seeing time all at once instead of linearly. The way we see time we would be sad at every moment after she died. The way the aliens look at time they see all of time at once so they always see that she died, but at the same time they always see every moment while she was alive and loved each other. That's kind of like when people say I wouldn't have changed anything because I cherish the time we had together. Some people can handle it well, other people would rather not even deal with it if they could avoid the pain that comes after. But I think if we could remember everything equally instead of just remembering mostly the last thing that happened , it would change our mind (2 viewings)",Waleed A,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 15, 2016",Waleed A,/user/id/907648168,RT,907648168,

4.0,"""Arrival"" is apparently based on the idea of aliens arriving on Earth. In fact, it is not. No spoilers, but it is clearly about the arrival of humanity at a certain level of existence, via language. The focus on language and linguistics is interesting to me because I teach English. But what is really interesting that someone has made a movie about language that is interesting, intellectual, paradoxical, and quiet -- and yet engaged audiences who like their science-fiction to be like Star Trek, Star Wars, Matrix, Avatar, etc. There is no action in this movie, as there is in the usual science-fiction movies. ""Arrival"" is full of silences and stillnesses. Nobody stands out. Yet every character is essential. The movie uses the idea of existential alienation (no pun intended) very well. It forces the audience to make  sense of things by forcing the audience to assume that the things make sense when, in fact, they never do. It's a beautiful movie.

5.0,"Quoting T.S. Elliot, ""This is how the world ends, not with a bang, but a whimper"". 

""Arrival"" is just this, but on a much deeper, more explained level. It deals not with weapons or defense of mankind in the classic manner, but with words and communication. 

Usually, when you hear science fiction or UFO you immediately think of what? Aliens, robots, mass destruction, technology, and the future, etcetera.  However, this film (while, yes a science fiction film) approaches the genre from a very new, a very original perspective.

The film follows Linguistics professor, Louise Banks as she catches brief impressions of what she initially understands as dreams, but turn out to be glimpses of the future, particularly her future. 

Almost immediately in the film, the plot is introduced. A foreign object appears across the globe in twelve different locations. The first contact with the UFO brings outstanding insight to mankind and hints at what they are really dealing with. The United States Government then proceeds by approaching Louise Banks, pulling her further into the bigger picture.

""Arrival"" isn't just another sci-fi film, it's a dramatic revelation about humans and who we really are. There are no big explosions, life-changing disasters, or robots. This film approaches the science fiction genre on an entirely intellectual, psychological, and theoretical basis. Yes, the film is about alien life, but it is more so about communication and human life. The questions this film brings to the table are bold, upfront, personal, and somewhat mind boggling. It presents language barriers as a primary conflict between two foreign nations, much like humans and their incapacity to communicate clearly and directly with one another.

I believe this is what I love most about ""Arrival"". Its approach is incredibly scientific and factual. 

If you are familiar with any of Denis Villeneuve's films (i.e. ""Enemy"", ""Prisoners"", ""Sicario"") they always leave you wondering. ""Arrival"" does leave you with questions, but they aren't so open as they are with a film such as ""Enemy"". This isn't an experimental science fiction film. The ending although left fairly open still leaves you with a sense of closure. Enough to make sense while still retaining the enigma of what the audience has just seen. It's very subtle.

In the beginning, Louise is reluctant to use the words alien or UFO and I can appreciate this because it doesn't make the film seem like a science fiction film. Of course, it is, but you (or at least I, myself) don't feel that way. You feel that it's something much more, it deserves more than just a sci-fi sticker planted on the cover of the DVD. 

It's been a while since a film has pulled me in allowing myself to immerse my mind in such a way as ""Arrival"" does. It's thrilling, intellectual, inspiring, and daring. The dream-like sequences revealing flashes of the future are done so perfectly and naturally. 

You can't really compare this film to another. As I said above, it's so original and creative. The writing is phenomenal. The casting is perfect. At first, I thought Jessica Chastain might fit the role of Louise better, but Amy Adams struck it out of the ballpark alongside Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.

This is absolutely worth checking out. Five stars without question.",Lucas K,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 15, 2016",Lucas K,/user/id/975704905,RT,975704905,

3.5,"'Arrival' is a different, semi-realistic take on the alien invasion film. It spends a little time introducing us to Louise (Adams), a translator, and then we get to see the UFO that's landed (technically hovering) in Montana. It's one of 12 - she's tasked with opening communications with the aliens. Some great shots of the ships (more like giant smooth rocks) and a good job of showing the different climate/atmosphere in and around them.

It's definitely not your typical alien film - there's a lot of tension and build-up, and no big battles or gory moments. Ian (Renner), a theoretical physicist and Colonel Weber (Whitaker) are there to help Louise, but it's pretty much up to her to determine how to communicate with the aliens (or giant squids). The music can be a bit overbearing at times, and the flashbacks seem to interrupt at times, but it all comes together at the end.

Didn't blow my mind, but it does delve a little deeper into how the world would realistically handle a potential threat of this magnitude. Would have loved to have seen more of the different perspectives from each site/country.

3.0,"To its credit, Arrival eventually answers all of its questions. The problem is that when the enigma is slowly disconnected, then so is the film.  Subplots become red herrings.  The narrative isn't ultimately preoccupied with the alien threat. It's fascinated by how language molds who we are. The idea is that people approach the world differently because of vocabulary. Reality varies according to the linguistic tools employed. Terminology frames our understanding. Dr. Banks is changed by the experience. That's the gist of the account, but I've purposefully omitted the closing truth. Your enjoyment of Arrival will derive out of how fascinating you think the final reveal is. Perhaps it will positively blow your mind. It has a philosophical gist. In keeping with the production's chilly tone, I found the ending too dispassionate. The denouement is rather underwhelming after such a promising introduction. Denis Villeneuve has erroneously created a drama left unfulfilled.

4.5,"The studio really needs to redo the trailer for this film, because I was sort of disappointed after viewing the trailer and believing that Director Villeneuve has given up on his vision after the not so successful releases of Sicario and Prisoners (only in terms of box office, as quality goes they are superb in every way). I do have to admit that the film was a lot more tamer than what I have expected, but not in a bad way either. It is sort of the anti- Independence day/Michael bay films if you can imagine. I think if they decided to release the film a month earlier, I think the film would have been much more successful at the box office but I am not sure why they decided to release it right next to Doctor Strange. If it was released even a week or two earlier, this film would have had no competition at the box office so it is really a shame to see this one go like this, as I would love to see more films like this.

Like the alien language puzzle that Adams' character pieces together, at times it is tedious, but those who stick with the film will be rewarded with a deeper message that will become apparent at its conclusion. Adams is excellent. B+

1.5,"Arrival is being called one of the best Science Fiction films in years. It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, ""really, that's it, that was so stupid."" Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!",Todd S,False,True,False,False,1.5,"Nov 14, 2016",Todd S,/user/id/551848470,RT,551848470,

4.5,"This movie is almost perfect.  Almost.  It comes so close, but there's a couple little nuances that keep it from reaching that point.  As it stands though, it's still one of the most original, intriguing, and gorgeous sci-fi movies I've ever seen.  The central premise is damn intriguing and wildly original.  I can't help but feel that any sci-fi movie with aliens must have started from a point like this, they just usually skip over that stuff because it's probably seen as boring, but when you really get into it it's fascinating.  The basic idea is trying to communicate with creatures who have a different vocal range, different alphabet, just all around entirely different way of communicating than we do.  That's damn intriguing.  Take away the alien aspect and you could compare this to what must have been early man's experience with people of other cultures.  And that's really the majority of the movie, just trying to communicate, but it strangely works.  Sure there's some twists here and there, the military being uncertain, terrorists wanting to blow crap up, but these are minor roadblocks that don't distract from the films primary point.  It's also just a gorgeous movie, with some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've seen in a while.  Without getting into spoilers too much, I gotta' also mention how I love the ending, and the sort of twist on the nature of the alien communication.  It creates some really interesting commentary on fate and knowing your own future that really intrigued me.
The problem I have with this movie, and it is a big one, is with Jeremy Renner's character.  He's really just kind of pointless, and he is unfortunately given an important place in the movie.  Again, without getting into spoilers, his chemistry with Amy Adams is a key component to the movie and it's twist, and I barely ever bought them having the chemistry of co-workers, let-alone anything deeper than that.  It left a bit of a sour taste in what was otherwise a movie that did everything right.  I can't deny the problems with Renner's character and the actors chemistry, it knocks the movie down a bit and keeps it from perfection.  Everything else about the movie is really really good though, sometimes amazing even.

4.5,"If we're lucky, a handful of titles per year offer movie lovers a chance to get to witness something that's original, thought-provoking and full of heart.

They're rare movie treats in today's climate and events that should be savored.

Arrival is one of these such movie treats; an intellectually intelligent Sci-fi that's highly likely to be regarded as a genre classic in the years soon to come.

Directed by Dennis Villeneuve (who has quickly become one of the industry's greatest current filmmakers), who here worked with screenwriter Eric Heisserer in adapting Ted Chiang's short story for the big screen, has created a Sci-fi event free of what you'd call large scale alien infused spectacle but instead filled a film with a quietly powerful narrative and ultimately stunningly moving centre that drives this unique vision to grand and near close to perfect Sci-fi heights.

Centered around the intriguing prospect of Amy Adams language expert Dr. Louise Banks, whose battling to figure out a way to communicate with an alien race that has decided to pay earth a potentially deadly visit, Arrival's narrative is best left relatively unspoken about as its complexities will be enjoyed that much more by those that know only minimal details about where Villeneuve and his talented cast are taking us.

Anchored by what could well very be an Oscar nominated turn, Arrival rides off the back of Amy Adams central turn and while the increasingly impressive actress is ably supported by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, Arrival really is her film.

Giving us a character who consistently surprises, just like the film itself, Dr. Banks is a likeable and believable creation whose dealings with the newly discovered race will encapsulate you with nothing more than whiteboard, a finch and some stoic determination.

It's mesmerizing in an hypnotic like fashion in the way in which we are taken along for the journey of these other worldly language-filled encounters and it's  an added joy that we're never fully sure of the alien's intentions until very late in the piece or fully understand where Villeneuve's plan for this poignant tale has been taking us until it dawns on us like the aliens mission late in the picture.

Ever so slightly held back by a rather forgettable collection of supporting characters, Arrival is comprised of an on form cast, vividly captured images from D.O.P Bradford Young and a haunting Jóhann Jóhannsson score all that back Villeneuve's overall vision to great results.

This alien invasion film with brilliantly constructed differences is a cinematic joy and this top class 2016 experience is but a further reason as to why we should now be signaling out Villeneuve as a potentially all-time great filmmaker, and why we should be excited for his next Blade Runner film that should very well be, quite the big screen marvel.

4.5,"I loved this movie - one of the best films of the year, for sure.  It starts a little slow, but the payoff is worth it.  This is a thinking person's space alien movie, which I found much more thought-provoking and ""realistic"" than your typical laser-blasting fare.  I thought highly enough of this movie that I flirted with giving it a rare 5-star rating (reserved for only my absolute favorite movies) before deciding this fell JUST short.  Still, a great movie.

2.5,"You will hear and see many positive reviews about arrival - this is not one of them. I would suggest that before anyone rush to see a film, they read at least 1 positive, and 1 negative review. It is my intention to make sure you want to see the movie ... that you think you want to see. So please bare with me as I explain why this highly rated movie, is barely a movie at all. 

Arrival fits into a breed of movie whereby, one is far better off simply asking a friend about what happens, rather than going to see it themselves. What happens in the movie has virtually no visual component. I suspect that Arrival was a fantastic book. The premise is interesting, a new perspective on a famillar story -- and the twist is really quite clever. This movie does make you think -- it makes you think -- ""Seriously? They made an entire movie where nothing whatsoever happens just for that one twist...? Well Okay"" 

I suspect that most people who enjoyed this movie, enjoyed that twist. Indeed, its clever. But its just as clever to ask someone about. Save yourself 116 minutes of absolutely nothing happening, and ask someone. 

Of every movie I've ever seen in my life - Arrival might be the slowest, and most boring. There are countless pointless scenes where we watch Amy Adams sleep, watch her sit in front of a computer, watch her type random things, watch her stare at pictures, watch her think. You don't see any aliens. In fact, Arrival could have been shot and filmed in 1950, and saved in a time capsule, because visually, we see absolutely nothing the entire film. We see fields in Montana, a black egg, and some beautiful ink-art. 

One might say that the movie is rich with character development. I would argue that it has no character develpment at all. There are NUMEROUS flashback sequences of Dr. Louise Bank's daughter spending time together. In each of these scenes, they are essentially a montage, and by the end, Louise remembers something she didn't before. Thats the only purpose they serve. About 20 minutes of wasted screen time to have her think of things she could have just normally thought of without reminiscing about her daughter. I can't say anymore without spoiling the twist. 

Anyway. Think very carefully if you really want to sit through 116 minutes of daughter flashbacks, watching people think and sleep, and fields in montana before you go and see this movie just for the clever twist -- which frankly, is ""Clever"" but not ""OMG THATS THE CLEVEREST THING IVE EVER SEEN"".",Alex W,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Nov 14, 2016",Alex W,/user/id/830360414,RT,830360414,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/635456690/picture

2.0,"Beautiful, but with a terrible ending.  
This movie was beautifully shot, with careful attention to ensure the audience was more focused on Amy Adams's character than the fantastic events going on around her.  It's a much more personal story and this is made clear from the beginning.  The cinematography is great, each shot adds to the mood and frames the emotions of the scene.  
But in the end, the movie falls flat on its face. We're starting to get into spoiler territory, but I'll avoid the big stuff until a little later.  Mainly, it ends in one of the worst Deus Ex Machina that I've seen in a while, and the solution is effectively magic masquerading as science. And the tiny nugget of scientific theory that they base it on is largely no longer accepted as a linguistic theory, according to the linguist I saw the movie with. I don't have a problem with magic in movies, but you have to be made aware of it early on and be told about it as part of the price of admission.  But I was sold a ticket to a movie about science, not magic.  
Now that we've waded through the shallows of the spoiler sea, let's dive in.
*SPOILERS*
Fairly early on I was reminded strongly of the Tralfamadorians from Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughter House 5.  Their language has no linear structure, making their sentences designed to be read as a whole, a characteristic of the literature of Vonnegut's species as well.  But Vonnegut tells you what he's doing in the second chapter of Slaughterhouse 5, not the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. Once I made this connection I could see a lot of how the rest of the movie was going to go and I wasn't really looking forward to it.
She too comes unstuck from time, by learning the alien language.  But in this version, it's a superpower allowing her to see specific points in the future at exactly the right time in the narrative, building to an ending sequence that is downright silly and not quite done as well as it was at the end of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  (I agree it's not exactly the same, but pretty close.)  
On a much more minor note, there was a sort of clunky explanation sequence where SOMEONE explains to SOMEONE ELSE (never fully explained who or why they were talking) that they've actually learned almost the whole language, rather than making that actually part of the narrative.  But glossing over some story that seemed like the point of the whole thing is nothing compared to the fact that learning a language gives the main character a magical superpower that allows her to make world peace.",Bryce T,False,False,False,False,2.0,"Nov 14, 2016",Bryce T,/user/id/975701299,RT,975701299,

4.0,"Arrival could not have arrived at a better time to give the message it gives. It is a beautifully shot movie that provides a fresh new take on a stagnant genre of alien movies. The cinematography is breathtaking yet minimalistic. The camera work is slow and let's us the audience absorb as much as we can in every frame. Director Denis Villeneuve after giving us Sicario last year, gives us yet another back burner thriller that keeps us hooked and mesmerized throughout. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are good in their roles and deliver what is expected from them, but this movie belongs to Amy Adams. She is outstanding here and delivers one of her finest performances. The best thing about this movie is that it is not the over the top alien drama that almost all movies in this genre are.

What I thought was so great about that episode was that the audience actually learned a small piece of the alien language/way of thought along with Captain Picard. I really wished for some of that from Arrival. A few tired tropes and 2 throw away lines about Sapir Wharf isn't enough to make the movie ""cerebral"" to me (what, has the intelligence of people dropped that much in the last few years?). Yes, the story is basically a realization of Sapir Wharf, but only in the most minimal and shallow way. Also, can we just get over 2001 as a template for a ""good"" science fiction movie. A movie does not need to be full of portentous silences and rely on vague, vapid implications of ""serious"" questions (i.e. the writers are too stupid to think of anything to actually say) to be a ""good"" movie.

4.0,"arrival is a very good film.

the designs of most of the sci-fi elements were excellent. casting, cinematography, score - all good. here's the problem: it doesn't always play by the rules.

similar to memento, arrival presents itself in a non-linear fashion, working towards a few moments that together add up to a big revelation (the similarities to memento end there). however - whereas memento clearly establishes its timelines early on and sticks to its format, arrival does the following:

- skips important scenes to hide information from the viewer
- intentionally misleads you from the very opening

don't get me wrong, as a whole, it's a great film. it never shoves anything in your face, and does an excellent job of pacing itself early on. that being said, I feel that its reveal isn't fully earned. skipping over crucial scenes and revisiting them later on feels like the audience is being cheated.

Some pictures, such as words, have low iconicity, while others, such as abstract forms playing through light, are highly iconic. The higher the iconicity of a picture, the more room there is for the audience to fill the picture with their own experiences and mold the possible meaning of the image. Movies, being uniquely a medium of spectacle, maximize their special potential as a medium by communicating through both words and ""visuals."" Films which require that the audience attend to its ""visual language"" are particularly, instead of haphazardly, cinematic. 
In the case of Denis Villenueve's ARRIVAL, the movie uses multiple modes of language (verbal and highly-iconic ""visual"") to communicate about the value of language. Such meta-communicative work was impressive, to say the least. In fact, I will say little more on the subject out of fear that my attempts to describe the experience of the picture will be utter failures. Perhaps more pertinent to those who have yet to see the movie: the plot of ARRIVAL revolves around a cryptographer, Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is approached by the U.S. government to help establish communication with an alien species after twelve unidentified vessels spontaneously appear around the globe. Dr. Banks is permitted to the meet the alien species, who attempt to communicate from behind a glass-like barrier from within their transportation vessels. World powers debate how to handle the presence of the strange vessels and fear escalates for increasingly violent civilians. Dr. Banks must race to learn the purpose of the alien visitors before a nervous world leader decides to attack the vessels. 
ARRIVAL, though tackling big issues and using a plot that unfolds on a global scale, is immensely intimate. The story is really and truly about Dr. Banks and how her personal pains become bound up in her ability to [not] communicate with a foreign Other. Adams is reliably subtle and nuanced in her performance, often conveying Banks' distraction and difficulty in the midst of seemingly unrelated circumstances. That is, Adams layers Banks on an emotional level with simple choices in micro-expressions and eye-movement. Her performance is, in my opinion, clearly worthy of consideration in the coming awards season. The rest of the ensemble is effective in their own way, but the movie is clearly dependent on Adams' ability to handle Banks' quiet, but affecting personae. 
Beyond having an excellent lead character and leading performer, ARRIVAL succeeds by being a wonderfully complex, but accessible piece of writing. Writer Eric Heisserer's masterful uses of meta- and hypo- narration to control the way information and exposition was filtered to the audience worked much in the favor of the film - especially in that the unique writing approach also provided Villenueve and cinematographer, Bradford Young, opportunities to layer additional visual communication to tell the story in ways that words would not have been sufficient for. Young should unquestionably be a strong awards contender for both his frequent use of direction and framing to create visual metaphors AND his wise decisions in blending CGI set pieces with natural shots, which created an aesthetically acceptable synthesis of the ""false"" and the ""real"" images. 
The content and arguments of ARRIVAL are perhaps the best testimony to the picture's importance and cinematic strength. Namely, the movie is ""about"" the ways that communication impact our life stories. The movie's central conflict is whether hope and courage regarding the intentions of a misunderstood, foreign Other would win out again fear and cynicism regarding said Other. Communication was both a barrier to be crossed (Banks did not know how to understand the aliens) and a tool to be productively utilized (by working with the aliens, progress toward understanding could be made). From scholarship in the communication studies discipline, we know that uncertainty is one of the primary reasons to communicate - we can ease our fear of the unknown by gathering information. However, we can never be one-and-the-same as another person, meaning that the Other will always have some element of uncertainty associated with them. ARRIVAL compellingly makes the case that it is better to be optimistic and gracious in our communication with others - even in the case of high uncertainty - than to let fear and paranoia cause us violently lash out against them.",Kyle H,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 13, 2016",Kyle H,/user/id/896629999,RT,896629999,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000555088049/picture

And needless to say, Arrival can be added to that list. It also should be added to the list of potential Oscar bait.

There are plenty of technical aspects to speak of. There are some first rate creature designs, language designs, and sound design. I thought however that the photography under DP Bradford Young had a few chinks in its armor.  It was not brightly lit in interiors or sun drenched in exteriors. The most common exterior motif seems to be a cloudy daylight backgrounds with unlit people in the foreground. So people were basically in silhouettes.

5.0,"Arrival is another film that continues a legacy of thought-provoking science fiction entertainment Hollywood has managed to release in the last few years. Arrival's story, to me, felt like it was building upon Interstellar (the dramatic effects of time dilation), Gravity (fear and hopelessness without gravity), and the Martian (a respect for botany). And now we have Arrival, a film that explores the power of language. Yeah, of all things... language. Remember that moment in Batman v Superman where the name ""Martha"" unites opposing forces? It was that dramatic shift in reality, in one's perspective, over a word -- a name, that opened up a new way of thinking. Arrival manages to do the same thing throughout its entire narrative. The main character is a linguist who tries to communicate with aliens and the movie explores how an intelligent being communicates with others based on its biology, culture, and perception of time and space. It's an alien invasion movie that touches upon the human necessity to understand and work with other cultures - both human and alien.

5.0,"An incredible and majestic experience that is as abstract as it is emotional. Movies don't get more original, unpredictable, or ambitious than this. Denis Villeneuve orchestrates all the visual and sonic elements of cinema to captivate and transport audiences in a way few directors can. Arrival is likely to go down as my favorite movie of the year and as one of the best sci-fi movies ever.

The wonder and awe of extraterrestrial life is extremely fascinating on screen when done right. Spielberg has certainly achieved it with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Denis Villeneuve is right on par with this film. It isn't one big crescendo like that film is, instead revealing the aliens towards the beginning, and building concept and story after. Arrival starts off as an awe inspiring experience and only goes up from there. The director's last film Sicario kept topping itself off, scene after scene, even when you think the last one can't be beat, and Arrival does the same, but on an even larger scale. 

One scene involves the characters entering the ship, where they travel up a lift and into a vertical cave with a white wall at the end that the aliens are behind. This scene is way longer than it could be, but it's done with such intensity and suspense to really make you feel like you're traveling with the characters into unknown territory, and it's beautiful. 

The atmosphere is so powerful from scene to scene, from the fog stretching over the mountains in the Montana location to the interior of the spacecraft. Johann Johannson's score is other-worldly, unsettling, creative, and majestic, adds a lot to the atmosphere without ever feeling intrusive. It often resembles the low moans of the aliens and the dark abyss of space. 

Amy Adams's character carries a lot of the emotional weight of the film without going for tears or obvious emotion. For how abstract and philosophical the film can get, it miraculously keeps itself grounded in reality and in humanity in a way most audiences should be able to connect to. It achieves exactly what Interstellar wished it did, and captures the same epic-ness of that film while mostly taking place within a square mile. There is political subtext about fear of foreign life that could easily be applied to the immigration and refugee conversations we're having today, about language and perspective, but even greater is the multidimensional lesson about our human condition. I would elaborate, but I certainly don't want to spoil anything.

This film unfolds in such a surprising way, it's among the most unpredictable and surprising movies I've seen, and the trailers certainly show very little. It reaches out so far and comes back with so much, managing to ground what it grabs in humanity. It's also surprising on a surface level, with twists that may shock you, but not in a way that draws attention to itself being a twist. The story takes you on a roller coaster and gives you absolutely everything you could ask for within its runtime, which is a concise two hours. 

Arrival has been getting a good share of critical praise, but I still feel like it's underwhelming compared to the experience I had. In every way, Arrival is the best of what cinema has to offer, and it's difficult to think of a film so simultaneously ambitious, thrilling, and emotional since Gravity. It gives you cinematic cake to eat up while you're watching, and afterwards gives you a lot to think about and discuss.

4.5,"Cerebral but powerfully emotional, Arrival is affecting and intriguing utilizing a raw and masterful performance from Amy Adams to guide this Sci-Fi film. So often alien invasion movies rely on violence and worlds at stake plots to display what would happen if aliens touched down on Earth, but what is so lovely about Arrival is its sense of intimacy and the power of communication. On a technical level, the visuals in this film are fantastic laying a coat of grimness over the proceedings and Johan Johansson's score is moody and ethereal creating an atmosphere of intrigue. Arrival is thinking person Sci-Fi. Instead of frenzied action, Arrival delivers thought-provoking themes on humanity while delivering an emotional experience that feels relevant to our current political climate. Unity and understanding are necessary for a safe future and Arrival, when it hits its rather unbelievable ending, you'll be crying too hard to care.

4.0,"With a unique approach to a fairly generic concept, ""Arrival"" is a pleasant surprise. 

When aliens land down on Earth, the question becomes, ""Why are they here?"". Led by Louise Banks, her team works to decipher the meaning of their appearance and how it'll ultimately affect the human race. 

Going into this movie, I wasn't that excited for it. I mean, I knew it would probably be good, but this concept has been used a billion times before. I knew there had to be something more and based on the trailers, it looked like it had something in store. However, I did not expect the huge twist in this film and I applaud it for the brilliant screenwriting. 

Amy Adams did a great job as the lead for this film. She brought a lot to her role and I'd love to see more of Amy Adams in the future. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker were great supporting characters and everyone did a solid job in this movie. I don't think that anyone will blow you away by any means, but everyone holds up well and they all put up good performances. 

The visuals in this movie were solid for the most part. I loved the the CGI and everything looked great, I just wasn't the biggest fan of the concept/character designs. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that everything looked great in this movie. The camerawork was spot on and the use of certain angles helped add a complex tone to this movie that other sci-fi films fail to capture. 

The main thing about this movie is the screenplay and the story itself. The director, Denis Villeneuve, has a wealth of great movies under his belt. His most confusing movie, ""Enemy', is certainly emulated in this movie. You can see the style and tone he directs with, and he's very intelligent. The story, without saying too much, was well written. It makes you think a lot and it adds an incredible aspect to it that I wasn't expecting. 

This movie is definitely more of a slow burn drama, and I don't think it'll be accessible for everyone. On a personal level, I recognize the ingenuity and rarity in this movie, but I personally didn't love it. There are still some confusing aspects about it and I'll be looking forward to the day where I can watch this movie again. The message is beautiful and it really makes you think, but I think I need another watch-through. 

In the end, ""Arrival"" is a great film. Some people will absolutely love this movie, but I also think it's one that everyone can respect.",Chris O,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 13, 2016",Chris O,/user/id/972194187,RT,972194187,

3.5,"[7 outta 10] ~ Don't expect alien invasion action with 'Arrival' cuz you won't get any at all, it's not that kinda flick. It's a slow and cerebral movie, totally opposite of the brainless fun action of something like 'Independence Day' and way more realistic.

'Arrival' is also completely different from recent space flicks like 'Gravity' or 'The Martian' or 'Interstellar' and isn't as good as those three IMO. Don't get me wrong, 'Arrival' is a good movie, it's just not as entertaining as those.

'Arrival' is basically a sci-fi telling of first contact, a story we've seen many times over but much more mysterious than what you'd expect, the movie's intrigue and complexity kept my interest.

The directing was subtle and visually awesome; the music was a bit loud and made some dialogue hard to hear; I got a bit of a 'Contact' vibe at some points; no ships landed in Canada, bleh; her epiphany and the movie's ending were kinda abrupt and less than satisfying; it was fairly drab and grey, and also dark; cephalopods and black ink; China now the go-to bad guys in movies.

I guess my expectations were too high for 'Arrival' as I was hoping for 'Gravity' or 'Interstellar' or 'The Martian' awesomeness. But despite it's ho-hum story, it's good. I have a feeling it'll still be better than the next space flick: 'Passengers' with Chris Pratt and J-Law.",Karl L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Nov 13, 2016",Karl L,/user/id/787140549,RT,787140549,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/702255191/picture

5.0,"First of all,  I was a bit skeptical from all the advertising, 100% on rotten tomatoes, best reviewed movie of the year and the like. Of course, I kept thinking of the last two times I was sucked in by all the hype and absolutely hated the films. But I guess I am somewhat of a glutton for punishment  (at least when it comes to movies) and decided, what the hell, let's see what we've got here and it was absolutely... Brilliant! 
I love most movies for their entertainment value. Every once in a while one comes along that I love because it makes me think, Arrival is one such movie. It takes the very familiar sci-fi premise of alien arrival and turns it on its ear. It was fascinating to watch Amy Adams brilliantly portray a linguist figuring out how to communicate and then what to ask and when to ask it so as neither side is misunderstood. (We could probably use more of that) And then add a dose of physics to the mix in the form of the non-linear quality of time. All of the science was interspersed with very real human moments between a mother and a child. It may not make total sense how it all fits together as you're watching,  but the pay off for watching and paying attention is a huge and satisfying ah-ha moment, when it clicks and you get it. As for the rest of the cast Jeremy Renner is fantastic as the physics guy and Forrest Whittaker the military rep. This film is thought provoking, intriguing, and very well put together.

4.0,"This film didn't astound me quite as much as Interstellar, although the ideas behind the story are fascinating and more thoughtful and philosophical than most modern SF cinema. The basic plot is something of a blend of Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End (in which multiple giant spaceships arrive on Earth all at once and which inspired the opening scenes of Independence Day) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, in which we have to figure out how to communicate with visiting aliens. In Close Encounters, the common language turned out to be musical tones. In Arrival, a linguistics expert (Amy Adams) must decode the aliens' spoken and written language, a language that appears not use tenses. The aliens' view of past, present, and future is a key plot element and I wont' say any more on that.

The film is beautifully shot, although most scenes had a gloomy pall and a muted colour palette. The pacing is probably slower than younger audience members are used to. In fact, the pacing, along with many visual images and some of the musical score, are reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it's clear that director Villeneuve is a fan of Kubrick's work.

4.0,"What an intriguing film. Not what you expect at all. 
Not so much a film about aliens (they are purely a plot device)..this is more about language and understanding and how our lives fit together. Its awe inspiring in places, emotional in others but at its heart it is really about acceptance and unity.
Adams and Renner are very good and have a fun chemistry as the scientist/linguist paired together to solve the reason for the 'Arrival'.
Nice performances as well from other bit parts and players, to help move the story along. Some beautiful cinematography used and the film does not throw the special effects in your face, as you might expect from 'epic alien ships desending to earth'. Everything is done with quiet subtley, so as not to detract from from the core of the story and the central characters.

In a Nutshell:  Earning 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, this intelligent sci-fi thriller features an outstanding performance from Amy Adams that already has garnered Oscar buzz.  This fascinating film will tickle your brain and warm your heart.

I didn't want to post my review right after I saw it, because I wanted it to percolate in my head and process it for a while first.  The more I thought about it, the more I loved it.   It's hard to write a review without giving too much away, so I apologize for the spoiler alerts below.  It's better to see the movie ""blind"", so to speak, so that you get to experience the unfolding of the story.  

""Arriving"" at the end of the movie and understanding it is a satisfying journey when you have to work it out in your own mind.

You know a movie has done its job when the audience claps and then slowly walks out of the theater, as they try to contemplate what they have just experienced.  That's what happened when I sat in a packed theater Friday night.  I can't wait for you to see it and read your comments!

Uplifting theme:  
""Language is complicated and messy and sometimes it can be both."" - Dr. Louise Banks
This is less about aliens and science fiction, but instead, more about humanity and working together.
""If you could see your whole life start to finish, would you change things?"" - Dr. Louise Banks    I loved the movie City of Angels and how, despite life being hard and even heart-breaking at times, it's still worth living....every minute.

Things I liked:
Director Denis Villeneuve usually makes violent, profanity-laced Rated R movies like Sicario and Prisoners, so I was happy to see him offer something else more family-friendly and cerebral.  
The cinematography is fantastic.  One of the best takes is when we first see the alien spacecraft in a field in Montana with fog drifting over the ridge.  Gorgeous. The camera rolls in almost a 360 degree span that is absolutely stunning.
It reminded me a little bit of the movie  Signs , which I loved, because of the lingering uneasiness that lasts throughout the entire movie.  The tension is handled very well.  It also reminded me of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Contact, because of the lessons we learn about humanity and our connection to the universe.
I loved the no-gravity chamber inside the spaceship, especially when the people inside could look far down below at the people walking around.  Super cool.  
I'm such a nerd that when Dr. Banks' lecture on the Portuguese language was interrupted, I was disappointed that I didn't get to hear it.   Ha ha 
We've never seen aliens like this before.  We've never seen a spaceship like this before.  We've never seen a written language like this before.  Three cheers for creative writers!
I was mesmerized with how the spaceships left the atmosphere....soooo cool.  
Did you catch Louise's earrings at the fancy event when she was talking to General Shang of China (played by Tzi Ma)?  If you look closely, you'll also see that same image repeated on her daughter's notebook.  Pay attention to other places you see a bird in a cage too.
There is a little bit of humor, which audiences always appreciate.
SPOILER ALERT.  As a university professor who teaches English, I LOVE that the film revolved around language and trying to communicate with the aliens, yet was really about how we humans communicate with each other.  Amy Adams' character (also a college professor) wrote, ""Language is the cornerstone of civilization.""  The gift that the aliens brought was perfect.
HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!!!   I LOVED the way that time was used in the movie.  Because we're human, we view time as linear.  That simple fact makes us believe that what we're seeing at the beginning of the movie is the beginning of the story.  The movie folds over on itself, just as the language of the aliens does.  Once Louise realizes that, we also realize what is happening in the story.  Very cool.


 

Things I didn't like:
Some viewers have complained about the slow pace, but I didn't mind, because it gave my brain a chance to consider all of the different story angles and messages.
Each encounter with the aliens cut off too soon.  I wanted them to last longer.
Jeremy Renner delivers a good performance.  Unfortunately, his character doesn't contribute much and he admits that they wouldn't be anywhere without Louise.  He figures out one thing without her and he makes a really strange decision in the end that I didn't like.  
What was the deal with Forest Whitaker's weird accent?
There is a lot of quiet mumbling, making it often difficult to understand what people are saying.
Sometimes things were out of focus, which was annoying.  I recognize that was an artistic choice, forcing us to focus on a specific thing, but sometimes it just annoyed me; I wanted to see everything!

 

Interesting lines:
""If all I ever gave you was a hammer..."" - Louise
""Every answer is a nail."" - Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker)

""Memory is a strange thing.  It doesn't work like I used to think.  We are bound by time, by its order..."" - Louise
""There are days that define your story beyond your life."" - Louise

Funny lines:
""You made quick work of those insurgent videos."" - Colonel Weber
""You made quick work of those insurgents."" - Louise
""When was the last time you did something stressful?"" - Army doctor
""Does this count?  Just saying..."" - Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner)
""Yeah.  That just happened."" - Ian Donnelly
""Trust me.  You can understand communication and still end up single."" - Louise


Tips for parents: 

Kids will think the aliens are cool, not too scary.
Yay for science and math!

This is a human story about language, time, life and hope, but I'll stop there because saying too much could take away from a first-time viewer's experience. Amy Adams is soooooo good. Ditto Jeremy Rener and Forest Whitaker. There isn't going to be a better movie this year, or this decade for that matter. Villeneuve is hands down one of the best directors working today.

Adams is wonderful as Dr Banks and Renner does a decent job in a support role but for me Forest Whitaker is not used to the best of his ability in this movie. I loved Director Denis Villeneuve's previous movies, and the tone and journey he takes you on in his movies but was very disappointed with Arrival. We have seen similar movies about humanity having to over come differences in the face of impending alien invasion and can more or less guess how it will end, Arrival is no different.

4.0,"I found Arrival to be overall too much of a slow burn to give it a higher rating but that doesn't mean that I didn't have a great time figuring this film out.  It is definitely one that makes you have to think, especially after leaving the theater to decide if it all holds together at the end.  Of which I think really worked, a reveal at the end could have fallen on its face and ruined what came before but it flowed easily with the film as a whole.  

Amy Adams carried Arrival on her shoulders, the rest of the supporting cast were fine but if she didn't sell her performance than what unfolds wouldn't have had the impact that it managed to.  Jeremy Renner's character though didn't have enough to do here, felt more like he tagged along as Adams did all the heavy lifting.  Would have been nice to make him more useful throughout.  

Of course the special effects were fantastic, the opening shot of their approaching the spaceship was the best in the film imo, incredible on a theater screen and was quite intrigued with how the film decided to make these ""arrivals"" both visually and with how they communicate.  I can say that Arrival is not a film for everyone, those who need more action will be very disappointed here, it is not that kind of film, not an Independence Day or War of the Worlds at all, closer to Contact if a comparison must be made.

Villeneuve (il regista, ndr) è bravo a bilanciare queste due sfere senza cadere nel banale o nel patetico e sfrutta appieno la struttura narrativa non lineare per coinvolgere e sorprendere lo spettatore. Menzione di merito anche per la potente fotografia che sa giocare con prospettive e (mancanza di) colore. Al di là dei paradossi temporali e delle inesattezze scientifiche in cui rischia di inciampare, Arrival è un film riuscito che si fa portavoce di un messaggio non proprio di moda in questo periodo storico: la mancanza di comunicazione porta alla rovina, solo aprendoci allo ""straniero"" l'uomo può raggiungere un nuovo stato di pace e prosperità.",Giorgio F,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 13, 2016",Giorgio F,/user/id/959192197,RT,959192197,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/755821447/picture

The plot of the movie could have been much better. I mean the whole movie could have been summed up in the first five minutes. The Army pulls in a world renowned linguist to communicate with aliens that have landed. After some dialogue with the aliens they give her their language as a gift in return for help in the future. She finds that the Alien language allows her to see the future, and may also be the key to interstellar travel. This is where the plot could open up, and do just about anything, but obviously the writers failed us. She could have then used the power she gained from this alien language to change the world, stop a war, end world hunger, save mankind from a hostile invasion that the first aliens were there to warn us about (the help that they asked for in return for giving her the language), travel the universe, save mankind by finding a new planet after inventing interstellar travel. I mean the sky is the limit when you can see the future. Anything she wanted to do would always be funded because all she would have to do is fill out a lottery ticket and the next day she would have money. This movie could have went so many ways, but instead she chose to live out her normal mundane life, have a child that she knew was going to die of cancer (because she could see the future) and write a book even though she knew all of that would cause her to get divorced.

What I liked about the film is that you're never quite sure where the plot is going or what will happen. This is definitely a film where you need to concentrate throughout and is as far removed from other alien encounter films like 'Independence Day' as you can get - there is no 'action' in Arrival. What it does offer is a puzzle that you will think about afterwards and try to piece together. It doesn't really give you all the answers, which again some people will like and others won't.

In the vein of Interstellar in that the concept or perception of time is the mystery and Contact in that there is on going communication with extra-terrestrials. However, the emphasis of Arrival is the art and necessity of communication. It is timely in that it rejects the instinct that we so easily fear what we don't understand and too quickly resort to violence. The smart quip by the doctor to Amy Adams' character when the impressionable soldiers attempted to blow up the space ship, ""they watched too much tv"" was simply poignant, highlighting one of the subtle themes of the movie which is to think circularly rather than linearly; to think with a more global perspective.

4.0,"Denis Villeneuve is building quite the resumé for himself these days. Following acclaimed films like 'Incendies', 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario', the Canadian director now brings us this chilling sci-fi drama that documents Earth's first contact with an alien race whose twelve shell-shaped spacecraft loom ominously over various locations around the globe. Charged with finding a way to communicate with the aliens and uncovering their true intentions, linguist Louise Brooks (played by a terrific Amy Adams with equal parts heart and grit) finds herself racing against the clock as the world's governments press for the use of military force against these mysterious visitors. Make no mistake: this is decidedly NOT an action movie, finding much in common with more cerebral, personal movies like 'Interstellar' and 'Contact'; it eschews FX-heavy battle sequences in favour of adult conversations, both human and alien.

2.5,"Quite disappointing, had potential to be a really good movie, starts out that Louise (Amy Adams) had a tragic past, and was lost in life, when an alien race touches down, and she's tasked to translate their language, and break the code by the military. The  first half of the movie reals you in and makes you hope for this ""DaVinci Code"" type of deal where she cracks the code to the aliens, and it's this big shocker of what they are here for, but soon after the half way point the movie takes a turn from trying to crack the code, to her love life and how she can see the future. The movie pretty much just drops off the fact that she is translating this alien language to save the world. It practically changed genres from Suspense/Thriller to Sci-fi/fantasy/drama/romance? If you are being taken on a date, or work at a movie theater and don't have to pay for the movie, I'd say go see it for the sole fact that Amy Adams is in it, because well she's a dime, and amazing in everything she does, but if you're at the box office wondering what to see, I do not recommend this movie.",Chris J,False,False,False,False,2.5,"Nov 12, 2016",Chris J,/user/id/975682059,RT,975682059,

4.0,"I don't disagree with 4 stars, but I don't agree with them either. Something just seems wrong with the rating. I'll give it that rating so people go see the movie. That way we can talk about it, which I think is the best part of this movie. It gets more interesting after it's over. I want to talk about why I didn't not-like it. I can't talk about this movie without spoilers. I will say, there's something there I want to talk about.

I define Sci-fi as a genre that uses fictional science as a framing device to explore the human condition. In Arrival, the fictional science isn't aliens giving a human the ability to perceive time differently. Instead, that ability is learned through understanding the alien's language. 

The fiction of changing your perception of time through language is an interesting one. Perception of space time is one of my favorite Sci-Fi frames. What they decided to frame is what doesn't resonate with me, although they framed it well. 

Consider the life of a human. Life gained and lost. Love and divorce. Gaining the ability to remember your life's future doesn't change that. On reflection, not granting the protagonist omniscient powers shows what sorrowful creatures we are and grounds the sci-fi. 

The included diplomatic tension and shock jock proselytizing serves as an accent to the theme of human frailty and gives just enough tension so people don't leave their seats. The cost of these devices is using the fictional science into a mcguffin to neatly tie up the story right when it was getting interesting. This detracts in a world where beings that can remember the future have a word for ""death process"".

Instead we are left to explore the concept remembering the future on our own. We are given some glimpses into the future of humanity in that this ability is shared. We are left on our own to consider what this means. We are alone to consider how language shapes our understanding of the world. The deeper and more interesting themes are left to the audience.

4.0,"An often mesmeric film of grand proportions and beautiful nuance, ""Arrival"" builds a compelling narrative without relying too heavily on SF cinema archetypes and succeeds in transcending them.  

Themes both political and relational are explored thoughtfully and meaningfully, as lead performers Adams and Renner imbue their performances with great emotional depth and vulnerability.  There is some of Spielberg's ""Close Encounters"" to be found (of course), with director Villeneuve also (very effectively) focusing more on character reaction to events rather than bombarding us with effects, and shades of Nolan's ""Interstellar"" and Zemeckis' ""Contact"".  

Yet the overwhelming feeling is that of a singular vision as executed by a visionary film maker, one which although is not as immediately impactful as, say, Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" or Nolan's ""Interstellar"", is one which slowly continues to seep in after viewing and provoke thought in the days which follow.",Matthew S,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 12, 2016",Matthew S,/user/id/800396036,RT,800396036,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/636006110/picture

5.0,"First Hit:  A very inventive and powerful film effectively illuminating the complexities of non-liner time.

This was my kind of film; it had suspense, was beautifully presented, the sound, including the music, was dynamic, and was it intellectually challenging. However, none of this would work without a clear commitment from the actors and the production team. They are to be commended.

The basic story is that 12 alien ships arrive on earth and hover in different countries. Each country having a ship assigns a team of people to try to figure out why they are here on Earth. Heading the military led team for the United States is Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker). His focus is to communicate to the US Government and the rest of the world what his team has learned. Looking for experts he approaches Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who is a professor of communication and linguistics at an unnamed College/University. She has certain criteria of how she will work on this project and when Weber rebuffs her, he searches out others. However, a short time later he has a change of heart, she is the best.

This scene, for me, sets the tone of the whole film. How Weber's team picks her up, the noise of being inside the helicopter, the tense excitement of the assignment ahead of them, had me ready for an adventure. The filming and sound were perfectly industrial and presents a sense of realism, the kind that tells you that you are in good hands under the direction of Director Denis Villeneuve. In each scene he beckons the audience, to sit back, open your mind, and enjoy the ride because this will be like no other alien invasion film you've ever experienced.

On the helicopter ride she meets her working partner Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who is a physicist. Although their ways of finding out and interpreting the information is they gain from the aliens is very different, they both agree it starts with communication.

There are a number of amazing scenes when they enter the alien ship; how gravity is upended, how they view the aliens through a glass like structure, and the fascinating scenes of Ian and Louise learning the alien's language. All through this film we are treated to Louise's memories of her daughter and little do we know how all of this comes together until the very end when she and Ian ""get"" the picture the aliens want to share with all of us.

Although I cannot say more about the plot, I will say the screenplay, cinematography, the concept, the acting and directing are top notch. But what really got me, was the ability of everyone who worked on this film to commit to the vision and present an amazing way to help people think more about understanding non-liner time.

Whitaker is the kind of man and actor that elevates every film he is in. For me he is one of the very best living actors and in this movie he's no different. He knows just how much of his intensity and kindness to put into every role and every scene. Adams is sublime. She plays a very complex character and there are few that could have pulled it off as well as Adams. I'm not sure how she felt about the role, but for me it was a role of a lifetime. Renner did a fantastic job in support of Banks. He led when he needed to and buttressed Banks inroads to the science of communicating with aliens. Eric Heisserer wrote an extraordinary screenplay. His ability to create a cohesive, engaging, entertaining and intellectual story while tackling the concept of time was amazing. Villeneuve had a clear vision of what he wanted and how this film was going to get there. From the odd look of the alien spaceships (they looked like large contact lenses), to the music striking the perfect background sound and mood, to how he got so much from each actor, his clear deft hand took us on an amazing journey for which I applaud him.

4.0,"This 4-Icee movie (out of 5) is not your typical alien invasion movie.  This is extremely well-done, but I have to confess this is one of those movies where I enjoyed the journey more than the destination.  If you are looking for a typical movie of this genre where there's all types of battles going on, you will be very disappointed.  If you are looking for an intelligent, thought-provoking film, then this is the one for you.

Amy Adams does an excellent job with her character. You feel her pain throughout the film, based on something that happens in the first 15 minutes.  Jeremy Renner does a stellar job in a non-action role (which it's good to see him in that type of role). He's actually a science guy in this one!  Of course, Forrest Whitaker gives his normal exceptional performance.  

Telling what I like without giving out spoilers is difficult, but here's my best shot.  I love the story of how the planet reacts when the aliens arrive. I can see everything that happened in the film happening in real life should such an event occur.  As I mentioned before, the pain felt by Amy Adams' character is well-done throughout the film as well.  As you're watching this you'll think, ""Why did they put that there?  That doesn't make any sense.""  Trust me that it will once you get closer to the ending.

Speaking of the ending, that's where I thought the movie let us down.  There was a huge drop off of things not articulated, and I think that perhaps the movie (just under 2hrs long) could have done a better job if they spent just a little more time.

In any event, I recommend this movie if you like thinking while watching a film.  If you only like action movies, step clear of this one.  No scene after the credits.",The D,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 12, 2016",The D,/user/id/974812409,RT,974812409,

5.0,"One way of making me watch a film, is by calling it ""cerebral""; And ""Arrival"" is as cerebral as it can get.

First, it asks the question what is this thing called ""language"" we are using? Language is our thoughts and words based on the reality we experience. What ""is"" Reality? 

If you enjoy questions like that, not weirded out easily by philosophical musings, you will appreciate Arrival.


*** SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE. WARNING: ***SPOILER ALERT***

I'm not gonna make a detailed movie review here since the movie has the basic ingredients of film. But I will take note of the insights inferred by the dialog and as the story unfolds.

If you are an alien and you have a different perception of ""time"" or maybe your reality of ""time"" is different (for example: time for you is not linear - not the typical past, present, future), you have a different way of expressing it and probably bound to be misunderstood from the get-go by a different species like humans, at least in this context. 

To use a less abstract example, science tells us that Time is linear since when you cook or make coffee, you can't unmake the coffee or uncook the food.

In the same vein, if in the human experience, ""memories"" are scenes or experiences from the past that we ""remember"" in flashbacks; what if you have ""flashbacks"" of the future? What if as an alien, time for you is like that?

Perhaps one would think this is all just fiction, but if you're the type who find it interesting that Time is now known to have a beginning, and what could there before time""? What if these aliens come from that Reality?

Actually, if you have seen Interstellar and Contact both ""serious"" sci-fi films, Time also played a significant part in which it becomes distorted or the future, present and the past become one and the same.

This reminds me of a recent scientific finding that the human consciousness moves on to live (aka a soul) in the quantum field. Experts who back this theory argue that our physical universe is just a perception, and that once our bodies die there is an infinite life beyond. Is this the science's term for ""eternity"". I guess at some point science and religion becomes one and the same too. But that's enough musing for now.

But movie of the year?  No, the story was told in a fragmented and out-of-order way (which was the whole point of it) and so it was somewhat anti climatic.
For me it came across as a Signs wannabe, but here the big reveal per se was out in the open and the fragmented story telling ""hid"" it in plain sight.  Except I've watched and read so many stories like this that I recognized the reveal very early, so I kept trying to look for some other way it could play out with a different reveal.  I enjoyed it, but was dissatisfied by how it basically used fragmented story telling to try to get me to accept a pivotal cause/effect paradox (which was only pivotal in resolving plot tension that was secondary to what it wanted me to view as the real story -- some confusion in story telling priorities, I felt).

By the end of the movie, if you were paying attention to the story you will have an answer to nearly every question in the story and it will only leave you wanting more, but in spite of this want-feeling satisfied.

2.0,"Let me start by saying that any reviewer who thinks this film is ""unconventional"" or ""unique"" or ""cerebral"" in its storytelling approach, does not have much knowledge of the science fiction genre.  There are numerous movies, and a plethora of books that explore the ideas presented in this film with far more depth and complexity.  I love thoughtful sci-fi, but the story here turns out to be utterly simplistic.  There's only one big twist and you can figure it out about half way in.  It's the classic sci-fi blunder of having an interesting premise, but failing to build on it.  If you remove the predictable premise then you are left with undeveloped characters and a tedious story.  There is no real ""exploration of the nature of language"" as many would-be intellectual reviewers are claiming.  The main characters slowly figure out what certain alien symbols mean, without ever explaining how they figured this out.  And the second form of communication explored in the film is memory, and it is done in a very vague way that relies solely on the use of the ""big plot twist"", which as I said, is entirely predictable if you have half a brain and any experience with decent sci-fi.  (Check out the book ""The Godgrave Initiative"" if you don't believe me.  It used the idea of flashbacks/flash-forwards to far greater effect, and years before this movie script.)

The production and emotional value, however, are generally enough to carry you through the rather tedious narrative.  Thematically it presents an introspective look at the nature of memory, and the value and/or lack thereof of prescience.  Unfortunately, because the storyline is ultimately so simplistic, it will not retain any rewatchability or further dissection as others of its kind, like the far superior movies, 2001 (the bench-mark), Contact (thematically brilliant), or Interstellar (flawed but mind-bending).

I am admittedly a sci-fi snob, but it's humerous to me to read many user reviews who laud this film as being so ""thought-provoking,"" and ""cerebral.""  Beware of these user reviews, most of whom fall victim to the same issue professional reviewers face--namely that they get so caught up in the egotistical idea of appreciating something the average person doesn't understand, that they end up applying far more meaning to this film than it deserves.  One user review said the movie had ""pedigree"" because it's the same director who filmed SICARIO.  Well SICARIO has a similar problem in that it takes a very complex issue, the Mexican/American drug war, and dumbs it down into a simple revenge story.  So I suppose that if you found SICARIO ""thought-provoking,"" or ""an eye-opening view of the war on drugs,"" then you'll probably have your head explode with the totally ""cerebral"" (yes, that's sarcasm) exprecience of ARRIVAL.",Dave V,False,False,False,False,2.0,"Nov 12, 2016",Dave V,/user/id/956084270,RT,956084270,

If you want to be able to see anything, save your money. The entire film is shot in the dark. It's nearly impossible to see a darn thing. The lighting is awful, on purpose. You can only see the aliens' feet, as though that adds to any intrigue.

2.5,"This is Hollywood trying to do too much. On the plus side, it wastes no time drawing you into the reality of alien arrival as experienced by the character of Louise, thanks to an efficient screenplay, quality production and Adams' thorough performance.  Its message is that the world needs to work together. The first third of the film is thrilling and fascinating when it enters the world of linguistic analysis of the alien language. The second third however swerves predictably onto the war footing taken by the impatient humans against the aliens. The guns come out.  China is blamed for starting it, followed by Russia, and Sudan, of all places - well at least Sudan is not part of the usual stereotype for this kind of thing. There are grabs from various countries. Unfortunately, to illustrate early on the danger of miscommunication, the script implies semi-jokingly that the near-genocide of Australian Aborigines was the result of misinterpretation. The final third of the film resorts to deus ex machina to solve the problem of the various countries taking the world to the brink.  It ties up the loose ends magically, but these were what gave it charm and depth, and should have been left well enough alone to hang there, while Louise became the world's messenger. The circle can only be closed with a horribly depressing element: an unhappy ending that is hard to relate to.

1.0,"I just saw the film: ""Arrival"" and if I were to describe it in one word, it would be: BORING!!!!!!

The first rule in making a movie is: ""Thou shall not be boring"".  Obviously, the makers of this film forgot this rule.

The scenes drag on forever. 90% of the film focuses on one woman and her emotional problems.  This is not what most people are looking for in an alien movie.  Despite what the previews imply, there is no action in this movie.  The whole film is about them going in and out of the ships and trying to translate the alien language.  

We then learn that the aliens want to reveal some powerful secret, but just when you think the secret will be revealed, it isn't and then the movie is over.

The CGI was also weak.  The aliens look like a combination of a tree and an octopus.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien and a few other past alien movies were vastly superior.

People were making jokes about how bad this film was as they left the theater.  Do your self  a favor and don't waste your money on this dull awful film.

3.5,"""Arrival"" is a science fiction film that came out yesterday and really has not made too many splashes as far as publicity goes. Many of you probably have heard the title but not much else. I would say that it is worth your time in the sense that it is unique as far as science fiction movies go. In short, ""Arrival"" deals with an alien visitation to earth. I want to highlight the term ""visitation"" because this is not one of the many alien invasion movies that have been churning out since the 1950's (possibly earlier). Rather the film focuses in on the struggles of contact that Earth would have should an alien visitation occur because of an obvious language barrier. Enter Amy Adams who plays a celebrated linguist commissioned by the Defense Department to assist in making contact with these aliens who have landed their ships in twelve locations around the world. In her quest to learn more about the extraterrestrial anomalies that have arrived on our planet she makes many discoveries the greatest of these being within herself.
Visionary director Denis Villenueve (director of Sicario) tries his hand at the sci-fi genre and succeeds in creating a unique and thought provoking take on globalism, communication, time, and perspective all wrapped up in the mystery of the unknown. 
Caution: This movie requires you to invest in it in order to have the best experience, both intellectually, and somewhat emotionally. Do not zone out during this movie otherwise you will miss something key. If you're looking for an action flick with tons of explosions, laser beams, abductions, and burning cities this movie isn't for you. However if you're a fan of philosophy and the science fiction genre--not just the invasion thriller, you will appreciate the unique perspective that ""Arrival"" has to offer. Also if you're a fan of linguistics you will also appreciate this movie as it really focuses on the study of language and how incredible it really is.

I had a few problems with it, though. First of all, they seemed to mumble a lot and it was often hard to catch what they were saying ( maybe it was the theater's speakers). Also, why, in this beautiful and profound film, did they call the two aliens Abbott and Costello? I found this to be demeaning and disrespectful to these brilliant, sensitive beings. Quite a thoughtless choice. And finally, as much as I enjoyed it, the ending was disappointing.

Now these critters that look like the yip yips from Sesame Street got it on with a 7 legged giraffe land ships in 12 different places on the globe.  Their ever so clever spaceship can travel space in an instant and appear out of nowhere.  They hover above the ground without any energy being used.  They can do all that yet the people in the ship have to be taught to communicate using a white board and a glorified version of ""Dick and Jane"".  Ok, maybe a little more advanced.  Let's say a glorified version of ""On We Go!"".  Google it.  You'll understand.  These highly advanced creatures are her toooooooo:  help us work together.  See that's it.  They sit there looking cool and making cool drawings and then just when we figure out what they want, they disappear.  Toss in a wibbly wobbly timey wimey worst Dr. Who episode ending and you get Arrival.  The ONLY reason to see this is Amy Adams.  Not because she does some great acting job.  No.  Because she's a hot redhead with cute eyes.  Or if you're a woman, Jeremy Renner.  That's it.  It's boring as hell if you take out the eye candy.

I guess the best way to sum this up is this:  Let's say, you see a van.  On the van it says ""Free Candy"" and you go into the van.  But there's no free candy.  Far from free candy.  Only tears and wishes that you never went into that van.  This movie is that van.

I personally felt that the film offers moments wonderfully so that we can experience these phenomenon in real time. Moments in the first half of the film moved very slowly and felt much like ""a day in the life"" which works well with these realistic depictions of fantastical circumstances. So many films feel rushed and crunch down moments of great significance so the film has a shorter run time...and thus appeases the masses. While only running just under two hours, Arrival did not feel rushed at all. This allows for the viewer to really engage in the story and really the fascinating social sciences of language.

There's nothing I can say about Amy Adams, I think, that hasn't been already, but she really is charged with carrying the movie and does so flawlessly.
The ending introduces some plot holes, or questions perhaps that the film can't fully answer, but is smart enough to leave room for audience interpretation and allow us to interpret certain aspects the way that we'd like to.

Amy Adams should get an Oscar nomination for her leading role as a linguist - all others are supporting parts to her strong performance as a world leading linguist.

The story and the movie are moving and proper adult science fiction. It exceeded my expectations seeing it on its premier day in USA. The actual running time of the movie is 1:50 (8 mins. are closing credits, so it totals 1:58). The aliens are radially symmetric septapods and rather advanced.

2.5,"When a movie is such that its genre is difficult to nail down, the combination of words used to describe what kind of movie it is are significant. There is a difference between a crime drama and a crime thriller, and between an action fantasy and an adventure fantasy, and between a horror thriller and just plain horror. The difference is usually a matter of focus and emphasis. So, when you go on imdb.com and see ""Arrival"" (PG-13, 1:56) categorized as ""Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"", you can be sure that distinguishes it from, say, the ""Star Trek"" films, most of which are listed as ""Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"". ""Arrival"" is one of those movies that's hard to pigeon-hole. If it helps, I'll tell you that I see this film as 20% ""Independence Day"", 50% ""Contact"", 10% ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and about 20% other movies which I can't mention in this review without spoiling the movie's twists and reveals... even if they are kind of predictable.

""Arrival"" centers around Dr. Louise Banks (multiple Oscar nominee Amy Adams), a brilliant linguistics professor at an unnamed university. The film opens with a montage of Louise as a single mother raising an intelligent and creative daughter who ends up tragically taken by an unnamed disease before reaching adulthood (not a spoiler, because this all happens in the film's first five minutes and is used mainly as character development). These scenes show Louise to be a doting mother, who is devastated by her daughter's premature death and has an understandably difficult time getting on with her life.

When 12 huge objects which look like filled-in canoes arrive from outer space and park themselves vertically just above the surface of the earth in seemingly random and mostly remote locations all around the globe, people panic, riot and... wonder. These things are just sitting there, not doing anything. The militaries which protect the countries where these objects are hovering discover that every 18 hours, a door opens at the bottom of each space ship, allowing humans to enter and attempt to communicate with the 7-legged, octopus-like beings which ""speak"" in seemingly random sounds.

Army Colonel Weber (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker), who is in charge of the site around a ship floating over the state of Montana, comes to the office of Dr. Banks (who had previously done some translation for the military and still holds a Top Secret clearance) to enlist her help. Louis is paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (multiple Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner) and, within hours, the two of them are accompanying Col. Weber and several military technicians into the Montana ship every  3/4 of a day, interacting with two large septapods (as they label them) floating in a cloud behind a transparent wall.

The process of communication goes frustratingly slowly. After Louis and Ian decide to remove their protective suits (so the aliens can better ""see"" them), the septapods begin communicating by spraying onto the barrier an ink-like substance that forms circles with different combinations and configurations of bumps and swirls on the outside of each. Louise and Ian painstakingly figure out the meaning of these circles and how to use the heptapods' written language to find out why they came to earth. Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders, whose concerns are voiced by an on-site C.I.A. representative, Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg), are growing impatient, while international military officers, following the lead of China's General Shang (Tzi Ma), are pushing for decisive action.

""Arrival"" offers up an original and very human, but rather dull sci-fi story. It's more intellectual than action-packed in nature and doesn't need battle scenes or imminent threats to the survival of mankind to make its point, but it could've used a more engaging plot. The movie ends up being not much more than a 2-hour sermon about embracing life with all of its ups and downs, which isn't enough to justify the film's long, slow build. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer (adapting Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning 1998 novella ""Story of Your Life"") arrive at the moral of the story in a way that's creative and memorable (and the cast is outstanding), but the journey is too tedious.

4.5,"So many film these days follow predictable beats and a standard predictable formula. This film though, is a real breath of fresh air, with an intriguing and thought provoking plot and some unexpected surprises. 
The premise sounds like an easy sell - aliens arrive on earth and languages expert Amy Adams must help decipher their communications. So, loads of explosions and a mega fight at the end right? Macho heroes with big guns? What we get instead is a decidedly cerebral drama, that owes more to 2001 than Independence Day (thank goodness!) with a quietly wonderful central performance from Amy Adams. I loved the look of this film (and desperately want Amy Adams' gorgeous lakeside house!) but equally great was the elegiac soundtrack and the dazzling production design of the alien ships. Just as the aliens language redefines our ideas of structure, the film cleverly plays with our ideas of storytelling and chronology.

4.5,"Arrival is one of those movies where you understand you're waiting for the resolve to see if it justifies the journey we've taken to (pun intended) arrive there. This doesn't mean the one hundred minutes prior aren't fascinating and worthwhile, but it's clear we're ultimately waiting to see what bigger picture these pieces are painting. This can of course be something of a double-edged sword given how the approach effects the re-watchability of a picture, but by the time we come around to the conclusion of Arrival it only seems repeat viewings will do nothing but make it more moving if not add shades and complexities to small nuances we may not have noticed upon that initial viewing. In other words, Arrival is a masterfully told narrative that deals in themes of interpretation and perspective through conveyors such as language and the guise of an alien invasion movie. What's interesting though is, despite the marketing, Arrival is hardly about an alien invasion, but more a film about communication and figuring out one another before jumping to conclusions based on cultural precedent or expectation. Arrival is about that fear of what we don't know and how such a phrase manifests when a genuine situation arises that it can be applied to. In the barrage of CGI summer blockbusters that depict alien invasions more as mass extinctions it's become easy to feel nonchalant about the ramifications of proof of life beyond our earth and solar system legitimately existing and furthermore, showing up in our backyard. In Arrival, director Denis Villeneuve conjures not only a palpable fear and panic that would sweep across nations in light of such events, but more he and specifically Amy Adams in an absolutely stellar performance highlight the sheer incomprehensibility of the situation. Giving insight to the smaller moments, recognizing the first time Jeremy Renner's Ian Donnelly touches the material this alien craft is constructed from as a major moment rather than choosing to ignore its significance speaks volumes. In this way, moments that are actually bigger play as that much more profound. Villeneuve is a master of restraint and the slow burn as he has shown in previous features such as Enemy and Sicario, but Arrival may be his most accomplished work to date as not only is it visually enrapturing, but the larger ideas the film has on its mind are applied to its precise visual sense giving the experience an all-around aura of awe.

5.0,"Moving and thoughtful sci-fi from the Director of Sicario.
When mysterious spacecraft touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert linguist Louise Banks - is brought together to investigate. As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.
An oscar worthy turn by Amy Adams is the films main talking point but everything on display here is expertly crafted. The cinematography & score are brilliant as well as the riveting screenplay. The aliens themselves look great too and the way they communicate is excellently realised. In fact another strong aspect of the film is its realism.
This won't be everyone's cup of tea, this is not about aliens levelling famous landmarks but what you get instead is a film full of ideas and genuine emotion.
There are scenes here that will make you shed a tear and it has an emotional gut punch of an ending.
Director Denis Villeneuve is fast becoming a major Hollywood player. Sicario is excellent but this is his finest film to date, it bodes well for his Blade Runner sequel due next August.
Arrival is a film that will be in your thoughts long after you have left the cinema, its uplifting quality is just the tonic we need after recent world events.

I have seen all of Villeneuve's feature length films except for his first, but I think Arrival may be his best work to date.  Yes, that includes the beautifully tragic Incendies.  And the gripping and visceral, Prisoners. Or the twisted Enemy.  And even last year's hit, Sicario.  Villeneuve brings the best qualities from all those films and brings them to one of the best sci-fi films in recent memory.

What makes Arrival so impressive is that it never forces the audience to take a leap of faith in logic or principles.  You know from the very beginning that it's going to be a grounded story told in a slow-burn style, and it delivers.  I was never sitting in my seat hoping for a groundbreaking twist or a shocking death, I just let the story be told.  And it's quite the story.

Amy Adams stars as a linguist who begins to work with the military once 12 massive and mysterious shells appear hovering around different areas of the world.  Adams is expectedly amazing and balances vulnerability and strength so incredibly well.  The film also balances a surprisingly human story with a global scope well.  I knew the original title for the film was titled ""Story of Your Life"", but I can't say I expected such a grand idea to feel so personally important, especially for Adam's character.  But this balance, was what I enjoyed most about Arrival.  It makes for some surprising and satisfying reveals later on in the film.

The entire sound department and production design team also deserve a ton of credit.  Sometimes you forget how important sound is in films, whether that be a score, random noises, or the lack of sound altogether.  I can't tell you how impactful the sounds in this film have on setting the tone and feel of each scene.  Equally as important are establishing the visuals appropriate for the tone you're going for.  The cinematography by Bradford Young as well as the production design from Patrice Vermette deserve some serious recognition come awards season.

Arrival in many ways is an extremely important film right now in our world.  It exemplifies what we can do together if we overcome our differences globally.  That togetherness is something the film tackles in a refreshingly unique way.  Normally, when sci-fi's attempt to tell a story about a potential alien invasion, Hollywood chooses to focus on merely America's side to things.  Rarely do we get to see the entire world have to work together to overcome whatever issues the film presents, and that was pretty cool to see.  For me, this film is not only important but groundbreaking.  Some of the storytelling devices Villeneuve uses to convey language, communication, love, time, humanity and many others are unique and gratifying to see in this particular film.  Go see this.

+Villeneuve does it again

+Adams deserves an Oscar

+Use of sound and visuals

+Unique

+Global and personal

The journey of figuring it out as the scenes played out was one of the most satisfying parts of Arrival. It was one great big puzzle.This is Amy Adams' film with a great support from Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. Superbly acted.

4.0,"So imagine if aliens come to earth and what our response would be if they opened their spaceship doors and wanted to communicate.  This is the basic premise behind The Arrival, and much like Director Denis Villeneuve's film Sicario last year, I liked this one very much but just a little less then that one.  The Arrival is a real thinker of a film and with that I would say there is a time it plots along in the middle, but you will find out that it is pretty much necessary for the payoff in the final act.  I really would like to watch the final 30 minutes again as I've been putting all the pieces to this movie puzzle together for the last 12-18 hours.  This is Amy Adams's movie and make no mistake about it.  She shows a ton of vulnerability and I think it comes of very genuinely.  The rest of the cast is also very solid.  The score and scope of the film is beautiful and will raise some goosebumps at least it did for me.  I've seen comparisons to Close Encounters and Contact and Interstellar, but I don't think that does this movie justice.

4.5,"Arrival is definitely in the running for the most interesting piece of the year, possibly the last five years. An interesting narrative with an even more interesting way of telling it, Arrival keeps the audience engaged and at the edge of the seats the whole 2 hours. Although the central idea of the movie-what time-space really is-has been explored in recent years in pieces such as Interstellar, Arrival tackled this theme with a completely opposite and extremely refreshing angle. Instead of trying to save a near apocalypse world, Villeneuve asked the question perfectly summarized by a line in the movie: ""If you can see your life from start to finish, would you change anything?"" Arrival also remarkably avoided the trap of letting the star, instead of script, carry the plot, as often seen in recent space movies, i.e. the Martian with Matt Damon, Interstellar with Matthew McConaughey, etc. However, that is not to take anything from Amy Adams, who delivered a fantastic performance in the lead role. She truly captured the brave yet terrified emotion a normal human would exhibit during an alien encounter. All of these made Arrival, although a scifi/fantasy, an extremely relatable and thought-provoking piece. You'll leave the theater not thinking ""that was a bad*** man/woman saving the world"" as in most similar pieces, but contemplating life and thinking what you would have done in the situation. The only blemish is that towards the end it felt a little rushed, too overly dramatic, and fell to the cliché ""the world is in trouble and I have to save it,"" but it quickly came back to deliver the ending it deserved.

1)-This film is beautiful in every way: it's visually stunning, yet simple, realistic, yet also fantastical in an almost tangible way. The sound design, ship effects and creature effects are all minimal and yet timeless and perfect. The script is creative, technically strong and different than most anything else out there.

2)-But it has one weakness and that weakness is the same one that most ""deep"" films have: it isn't as deep as it thinks it is and it presents certain human problems at certain key plot points very two dimensionally, but not as badly as many other sci-fi films (like Trek)... it's more that certain philosophical concepts pivotal to the film are deep and cool, but they're ultimately absurd and are a real reach. it's almost a New Age optimistic fantasy.

 But don't get me wrong, it's all handled so much better than most films with a similar philosophical problem that it can almost be forgiven.

advice: if you love the ideas in The Fountain, Interstellar, Memento and Star Trek TNG, you'll love it.

It is a bit sad that a script like this passes as ""for the thinking person's sci-fi"" because any thinking person will scratch their head as two why there is only one language specialist, no biologist, etc. in the team.

Any person who knows real scientists will also find the characters to be Hollywood fantasies (as usual), i.e., artificial constructions that tick the ""movie scientist"" box but are pretty far removed from reality.  

The film takes its time regarding the communication with the aliens first (good) but omits basic principles of communicating with someone (why did the script not take clues of human kind's authentic attempts to communicate with an alien species?) with a different language, and unsatisfyingly very suddenly jumps to complex forms of communication. 

Also, script writers seem to help themselves from same ideas box all the time. Can we have a sci-fi movie that does not play on the Interstellar theme (which was not new then and does not explain how the paradoxes of non-linear time are avoided)? 

I don't want to complain too much because I enjoyed the film which was in large parts to Amy Adams' fantastic performance. She easily carries the story which is saying a lot (no spoilers, but only a very few select actors could have made it work like Adams did). 

I also enjoyed the film because it was about more than aliens arriving and trying to learn to speak to them. But a 96% critics rating is just putting up the expectations in regions that are not justified for this effort which is very good (if you can accept the basic premiss which not everyone will be able to do), but not excellent as in flawless.",Thomas K,False,False,False,False,4.0,"Nov 11, 2016",Thomas K,/user/id/906328817,RT,906328817,

3.0,"Arrival wants to be profound, and it is.  It wants to have a deeper meaning, and it does.  It also wants to get the audience emotionally attached to its characters, and here is where the film fails miserably.  2/3 isn't bad, but emotional attachment can make or break a film like this.  Amy Adams does her role justice, but the supporting characters around her make the film fall apart.  In other words, I feel that restricting the audiences view so often to only Adam's point of view is the reason there is no emotional attachment to the characters.  Interstellar made you care about Murph, not just because she was Cooper's daughter, but because you actually got to know Murph.  You loved her inquisitive nature, and you felt the connection between them.  In Arrival, Hannah is just Amy Adam's doomed daughter.  While you naturally feel empathy for a parent losing a child, you don't actually know Hannah.

5.0,"Non-action science fiction films are becoming rarer than hen's teeth in mainstream cinema, usually skipping the big screen for a video-on-demand release due to their tight budgets. The one-two punch of this year's Midnight Special and Arrival will hopefully change that. Fresh off the modern masterpiece that is Sicario, director Denis Villeneuve again showcases his incredible talent by crafting a deeply thought-provoking motion picture that credits its audience with the sort of intelligence and maturity so few movies are willing to do. When alien spaceships appear in 12 random locations around the globe, the international community must band together to figure out who controls these vessels and, more importantly, what their purpose on Earth is. Enter Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams - amazing), a professor of language who is brought in to communicate with the extra-terrestrials aboard the spacecraft situated in Montana. Banks has her own personal problems though, with memories of her dead daughter permeating throughout her thoughts. These two coinciding plots are handled with immense care and precision, ultimately bringing an intense poignancy to the overall story that culminates in a fantastic final act twist. The unpredictability of the reveal is inarguably clever, but it's the extra layer of emotional depth it adds that really hits home. The imagery is spectacular too: the alien vessels are simple yet beautiful; the squid-like creatures are simultaneously frightening and graceful; and the gravity-defying environment inside the ship is presented with subtle wonder. The icing on the cake is the profound auditory experience that the film offers, with the glorious, otherworldly sound design and an affecting, sonorous score conducted by Jóhann Jóhannsson (whose Sicario score should've won the Oscar earlier this year). A contemplative movie that eschews big budget action for provocative musing, Arrival is a tense, emotional and utterly gripping sci-fi drama.",Troy C,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Nov 10, 2016",Troy C,/user/id/901318118,RT,901318118,

5.0,"When Sci-Fi is implemented on screen in a auteuristic manor, from a director who has been known to make viewers think long and hard about what they have just witnessed, it goes without question that you should be going into Arrival expecting something profound. I will start off by admitting that there is no way everyone will be happy with this film. If you lose interest in any moment, the final impact of the finale will have you bored and scratching your head. That being said, the underlying message that is slowly being revealed throughout the course of this film is more than worth the price of admission. If you are sucked into this story, it will be very hard to find any glaring flaws with its narrative, but it is told in such an unconventional way that viewers may check out 20 minutes in. For myself, this is one of the smartest and most profound viewing experience I have had all year. Here is why Arrival is modern cinema at its finest.

To put it in layman's terms, Arrival is simply about an alien race that lands on multiple areas of the earth. A team of scientists and a linguist are recruited to explore the ship in order to discover the purpose for their visit. Flashing back and forth to scenes that makes no sense until the conclusion of the film, it requires your undivided attention and possibly multiple viewings to full grasp everything that is being shown to you. Average moviegoers who expect to see an exciting alien invasion picture might as well stay as far away from this film as possible, because although it may seem like a simple story of a group of people trying to learn an alien language, there is much more going on behind the scenes, making this one hell of a roller coaster ride if you follow every frame and line of dialogue.

My first word of advice before entering a screening of Arrival would be to make sure that you are completely awake for the proceeding two hours to come. The third act, revealing why everything had been shown in a certain order is out of the world genius. Some people may not feel the impact if the film did not have your attention from the very beginning, but it will remain in your thoughts for days to come. There is so much to absorb in the final act, but it helps when you enjoy the presence of the story's core characters. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner work very well together and although it seems like they are meant to be on the same team together, there is so much more to come. For a film that is about an alien race coming down to earth, I am surprised that aspect was the least necessary portion of the film, while simultaneously being the most essential to the plot.

Many people will walk out with different opinions on this picture hands down, but it is all about how you interpret the film for yourself. Yes, there is a specific message being told, but there are so many other aspects that require your attention that you may just find yourself lying in bed at night trying to decipher it. I almost feel that I am reviewing this film prematurely, but I think I will still feel that way after 5-10 viewings of it. Arrival is a one of a kind film that I will find myself revisiting many times to try and get the most out of what director Denis Villeneuve has created. Due to the way this film was adapted by Eric Heirsserer, I was captivated from start to finish. How he was able to tell multiple stories that made no sense throughout the entire film, only to explain that those scenes are what made the most sense all along, is a twist within a twist if I've ever seen one.

I truly believe that hardcore fans of cinema will get the utmost out of this picture. The average moviegoer who does not know what they are getting themselves into, may not be too thrilled with the finished product. Arrival requires you to expand your imagination, as well as remember every single moment of the film in order to feel the full emotional impact. With jaw-dropping cinematography, impressive visuals for such a small budget, characters that you come to really care for by the end, and a perfect overall story when completed, Arrival is easily one of the most spectacular experiences you will have at the theatre this year. As much as I love this film, there will be many people who find it boring and uneventful, which I totally understand. The pacing of this film requires a lot of patience from its viewers, but I was so sucked into the experience that I forgot I was watching a fictional story at times. Arrival is one of my favourite films of the year, easily Villeneuve's best work in my opinion, and you will definitely be seeing some nominations come Oscar season.

3.5,"Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners [2013], Sicario [2015]) brings us Arrival a film about a linguis named Louise (Amy Adams) who is brought in by the military to communicate with aliens inside of a ship floating above Montana. Alongside her is a scientist named Ian (Jeremy Renner) who helps coordinate with the team and other scientists around the world trying to figure out why these aliens suddenly appeared. The film is shot beautifully. Some really great shots here and the score is excellent conveying a ton of emotions. The film itself runs a bit too slow though for me! It's literally segments of Louise trying to communicate with the creatures and figuring out their strange way of communication. The thing that make the movie worthwhile is its incredibly strange and bizarre twist! I won't say it here, because its a really good payoff. It ties everything together so well and as long as you pay attention during the film its really a beautiful ending. The movie won't be for everyone.

4.0,"Another year, another highly anticipated film from acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve, the director of ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"" is back at it again this time in the science fiction genre with ""Arrival"" starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner.

Do they want war? Or maybe something else? Well that's for Louise to find out, but ""Arrival"" isn't really about that, it's a love story, it's a sort of coming of age story, a film about healing and revelation, beautifully told by Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer.

5.0,"There are few movies from the sci-fi genre (or any genre, mind you) that take a step ahead and decide that maybe they should do something a little bit different. You know, introduce something old that maybe has been explored in cinema before, but from a new perspective. Arrival is a very human movie, a very realistic movie that takes its time to set up characters, that allows for some realism within a very unpredictable and controversial plot. The movie of course, is about human beings coming in first contact with aliens, almost entirely from the general perspective of a successful language interpreter. That's all I can say.  Science fiction is a genre that one day although has the word fiction in its name, could possibly come true (minus a few quite ""over the top"" exceptions). This film has such an incredible sense of emotion that is extremely affective thanks to terrific performances (Amy Adams' best, might I add) and an exceptional soundtrack with dark, yet perfectly fitting music. I wanted to save this for last. Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today, and this movie confirms that. Every single shot is so pristine and works so well, adding to the overall tone and mood that the audience should feel. The ending is also very well done, and leaves plenty of thoughts for us as viewers while also having a chilling resolution.

4.5,"In the last few years we have seen an increase in intelligent films about space exploration and the possibility that something else may be out there. Arrival is one to add to that list with its insightful probe on how we communicate with extra-terrestrials. Don't worry; this feels more Close Encounters of the Third Kind than say the dreadful Independence Day Resurgence. This is the first of two high-profile films for Amy Adams this year. She also stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in Nocturnal Animals. Here she plays Dr. Louise Banks, a college professor who specializes in linguistics. What seemed like a normal day on campus is anything but that when she arrives to class to find that a majority of her students are gone or buried in their phones. There is breaking news that twelve space pods have landed across the world. They are egg-shaped and massive in size. Little is known about the pods but the U.S. Army has been able to successfully enter the pods and note the presence of an alien species. Dr. Banks is approached by Colonel Weber (Whitaker) of the Army to join their team and translate the communication that has been captured from the aliens. She's partnered with Dr. Ian Donnelly (Renner), a theoretical physicist who has a slighter different way of thinking about the origin of a species. Together they risk their lives by getting right up close with the aliens in order to bridge the gap of communication between each species.

Director Denis Villeneuve continues to push his way through the pack as a director who deserves to take notice. His 2013 film Prisoners shook me up, and he was on many ""best of"" lists last year with Sicario. I would expect Arrival to be part of the awards season banter due to the complex nature given to this story, as it is so much more than a simple sci-fi popcorn flick about aliens crashing down to earth. The short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang serves as the basis for the film, which has been expanded by screenwriter Eric Heisserer (The Thing, Lights Out). That title makes more sense when you learn about another aspect of Dr. Banks's life. I'm not about to get into that, as it would prove to be a huge spoiler.

Villeneuve hooks you right from the beginning. It's a tender opening but accurately sets into motion the intensity of what's at stake. Dr. Banks is the only character given any sort of exposition and that's kept fairly minimal at most. It's a film that lives very much in the present for its characters and the audience. Bradford Young's precise cinematography keeps the mystery going with its limited scope at any given time so the audience never gets ahead and sees more than what Dr. Banks or Dr. Donnelly are experiencing as they learn more about the aliens. The whole look of the film is intriguing to the point where I could never take my eyes off the screen. I feared I would miss out on some little detail or discovery.

The film has a plethora of lofty concepts that can't all necessarily be answered or given equal measure on the first viewing. The basic concept of communicating with aliens is at the forefront, but Dr. Banks goes about it in a very elementary way using visual clues and tactile gestures that are at the forefront of attempting communication with anyone that doesn't speak the same language you do. Banks' continual exploration of communication challenges her outlook about life and how we view the time we are given. I'm being vague for a reason, but it all comes full circle in the film's conclusion. Arrival also tackles the global impacts of such an unexplained occurrence by placing the twelve UFOs all around the world. It forces global communication and teamwork on what they are learning and experiencing at each station. As you can imagine it escalates quickly to a war-like atmosphere based on the doomsday fear mongering that spreads.

There are moments that are driven by the intimacy at hand with Amy Adams' character. You'll quickly notice Jóhann Jóhannsson's score come into play to emphasize this in contrast to the vastly unknown happenings around her. Adams has that maternal side to her that embodies the heart of the character all the while having that direct nature to prove she knows what she's doing and can be taken seriously in male-oriented workspace. It's by no means a showy performance but one that packs the punch needed for the ending. She's partnered with her American Hustle co-star Jeremy Renner who made me take notice in what could have been a thankless role for another actor. He exudes just enough personality as Dr. Donnelly as to not overshadow Adams. The same can be said for how his character compliments the work done by her character.

Recent films like Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian all made my best of the year lists. As of now, Arrival is on that list. They each pose such fascinating ideas of what the depths of space may behold. Arrival takes a slightly different approach by keeping it grounded on Earth, but it still asks those weighted questions. It fires on all cylinders as its stunning visuals, score, and the questions posed by Dr. Banks mirror the exact dialogue about communication that the film seeks out. It's not necessarily a film that will leave you cheering afterwards, but I bet it will be that thought-provoking movie that sits with you longer than expected.

Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Don't be surprised if you find yourself wanting to see it all over again.

5.0,"'Arrival' is a Sci-Fi Drama starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner and directed by the amazing Denis Villeneuve ('Enemy', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario'). When alien spacecrafts descend down to Earth the race is on for Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) to decipher their language and determine whether they are friend or foe in what is a must-see film for 2016. This film is amazingly directed by Villeneuve, features great performances with captivating on screen chemistry, a thrilling plot, and like all of Villeneuve's films features stunning cinematography. I was so pleasantly surprised by this film as i went into it hoping for greatness but also a little worried this was going to turn out to be a fairly average Sci-Fi invasion film. But this film completely amazed me as it had so many layers, was incredibly thought provoking, and had amazing plot points with things going on under the surface that you have no idea about when you see the trailer. 

The main cast in this film were fantastic with their amazing performances increasing the dramatic tension, injecting plenty of emotion and also a tad of humour. Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner were great elements of the main cast but felt like secondary characters when compared to the performance Amy Adams gave in this film. She was so captivating and really delved into what turns out to be an increasingly more complex character as the film went on to the point where i think everyone in the theatre forgot about her as Lois Lane. She has great on screen chemistry with Renner's character and it did make for some more relaxing slightly humorous scenes. Apart from those 3 performances the other very minor characters were more stereotypes than anything but during the film they all command so much attention that you will very barely even notice. 

There is so much i cannot talk about when it comes to the plot of this film because so much of it is very secretive.... and it is a lot more than you may think. What i can say is this really does get to parts that will require you to put your thinking caps on and figure out what is happening and why. But the payoff is HUGE as the revelations that occur throughout the film i definitely didn't see coming and makes the whole film tie together so well that this commands a second viewing much like Villeneuve's previous films. And just like his previous films the Cinematography here is beautiful. Some of the shot choices and the angle at which certain scenarios are viewed had me in awe more than once throughout the film. This time it was not Roger Deakins it was in fact Bradford Young helming the cinematography who is younger and definitely has a lot of talent and a good eye for beautiful shots. 

So in the end i cannot stress enough how much of a must see film this is if you are a fan of Sci-Fi and more specifically the thought provoking kind. The plot is fantastic, the cinematography is on point, and the performances helming the film are very enjoyable to watch as they add to the drama of every scene. And it is all tied together by Denis Villeneuve in a nice little package creating what is most definitely one of the best films of the year.

5.0,"I love stories. Always have. And to me, film, is one of the best, and, sometimes, worst methods to get a story across. When done expertly, and with passion, film can create in it's viewer an orchestra of emotion. 

The very best films, to me, are the ones that people can open a dialogue of great conversation over that lasts for hours afterward. They are the true artful films, and they are what fuels my passion for the medium.

I am, and always have been, a sit around the campfire and share sort of person. I love the nuance and intimacy of just being socially in touch with fellow humans and sharing thoughts, ideas, laughs, food and drink with whomever is there. That interpersonal communication, to me, is the spice of life. 

I want to talk about an amazing film that I just watched. It pulled all of those things together. It pulls the tiniest details out and scrambles them into a tapestry of concepts and emotions, and it is very powerful. That film is The Arrival and, to me, it's really fantastic. 

This is not really a sci-fi movie, and yet it is. Its a complex and yet simple tale that is told in a truly unconventional manner and it is resounding in how it sneaks itself into your thoughts for much longer, afterward, than you think. 

There are many facets of the movie that will certainly make you think about things. And there are enough details that once revelations are made, will propel you to want to re-watch it. I'm certain there are answers that are within it that are proposed in the presentation and that is profoundly beautiful. It's not finger food for the brain, but a complex mix of tension, love, emotion, confusion, and detail.

If you are looking for a simple straightforward sci-fi movie, this really isn't what you are seeking. It's a movie about the importance of communication, about time and relativity (in very abstract and diverse connotations, and about the details. 

This, for me, is this year's Ex Machina. It's a beautifully painted picture of what the balance of mankind is and of where the significance of our societal and cultural differences are collectively bound and paved by our ability to communicate, not only with ourselves, but with others. 

If you're looking for that heady and thinky film that will leave you inexplicably thinking about the gravity of it's story for a bit afterward, this is that movie.

4.5,"Arrival

Denis Villeneuve, director of last year's looming, dark Sicario, has a dabble with science fiction, about some otherworldly visitors with unclear intentions. It's central to Amy Adams' Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist who is enlisted by the U.S. Military to attempt to communicate and understand the visitors reasons. 

Recruited by stern, demanding Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and teamed up with scientific mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they travel out to a remote beautiful part of Montana to start conversation with the extra-terrestrials. 

Something that is always a challenge for this particular genre is the creativity, as there can be endless possibilities but also that danger of becoming so unbelievable it becomes ridiculous or possibly annoying. Fortunately it's a believable story and has a deeper meaning than just the usual alien encounters with an unknown purpose. Are they friend or foe and if they're no threat then what do they want? 

What is an integral part of the plot is that the this isn't the only encounter and is actually one of twelve hovering above supposedly strategic locations around the globe, which still remain a mystery. As usual, Hollywood has to give the American point of view with the rest of world taking a back seat or worse, being disgruntled, fearful trouble-makers. In fact, there's possibly more of a threat from our own actions. 

It's tackles how we, as a human race might deal with an unexplored situation like this and begs to question humanity as a whole, hoping that our stupidity does not get the better of us. There's so much more to the plot than what any trailer suggests and whilst almost agreeing with the hype of being ""the greatest sci-fi movies in years"" it isn't entirely original or unpredictable having elements of Signs and Contact. 

Things get weird, and like with Interstellar, all isn't what it seems and while some of it is predictable, it's clever enough to not give everything away, even at the end, some questions remain unanswered, leaving viewers in wonder and discussion. 

Darkness is no alien to Villeneuve's style and his use of light is brilliant, especially during the conversations and visions. But what is incredible is the sound, the language sounding like whale song or elephants. Again reminding me both of Signs and Contact where sound was a key element of the films. 

The score is also amazing, Villeneuve's usual composer Jóhann Jóhannsson composes an immersive soundtrack especially the vocal/choral songs like ""Kangaru"" and the build up like ""Hydraulic Lift"" that raises the tension tenfold but there's a certain ambience about it as well. 

Superbly paced, it's suspenseful and engaging. While there are plenty of moments where viewers might get lost, it rushes to its conclusion before it gets complete confusing. Intriguing plot, strong performances and good creativity makes it's a definite must-see, even for non-sci-fi fans.

3.0,"My beef with this movie is mostly about writing, plot, pacing and substance. The acting in this film is well done. I'd say Jeremy Renner did the best job of making something out of what he had. The role of Ian wasn't that much in and of itself, but he gave some depth and warmth to it. Adams was okay as well. Forest Whitaker deserved more time looking into his character. 

That said, I had a problem with this film. Or the two films that are ham handedly twisted together. 

There's a film about a woman who knows she'll have a daughter who'll die of an incurable disease, but elects to have that child anyway. It's a slow drama with heavy handed violin music in the background and lots of out of sequence snippets of her dead daughter doing things that are meant to be poignant and haunting but feel manipulative after a while because they're clumsy and have no subtlety. I felt like, ""Okay, we get it. She used to run around laughing and draw pictures and it's really sad that she's dead and it makes Louise cry"". It's slow and syrupy and ultimately boring. Especially given that Renner's character (Ian) had the more interesting POV on that situation but all we learn is that he's mad about it and divorces her. 

And this could be it's own separate magical realism-based drama with sad music.

(Side note: the beginning and ending tracks are music that I heard on the Shutter Island soundtrack, so they're recycling apparently??)

Then there's a sci-fi film that actually had potential, but didn't quite stick the landing. It took the idea of first contact and went somewhere uncommon with it. Not entirely unique, but not the usual way Hollywood presents us with a first contact scenario. The linguistics and science of it were accessible, I think, to the average audience member. It also shows how language is less concrete and absolute than we think

The most interesting part of the film is the aliens and what their ultimate goal is and the mystery of why they're just hanging out in big ships. It frustrated me as a viewer that when we do find their eventual plan, we literally only get a hot minute of it before we go back to the cliched ""the military is incompetent and doesn't understand science"" plotline. Their way of communicating is fascinating and I would've loved for a biologist or two to come in and comment on them. Especially because they're not symmetrical. Most life on Earth with limbs/fins has an even number, half on each side (see also: dogs, whales, centipedes, your mama and so on).

However, that's the smallest part of the film. And it's laced with this heavy handed portrayal of military and international politics. A portrayal that didn't make sense. 

The movie wants the audience to believe that China would obviously be the ones to turn on the heptapods in an act of short sighted aggression, and would be unable to see anything but a threat in the heptapods because apparently they're using mah jongg tiles to talk to them and since mah jongg is a game with a winner and a loser, this means China for sure will only interpret it as threatening. 

Unlike our sad white lady heroine who's making friends with them and proving that if the Chinese leaders/teams would just try to be more like her (and the U.S.), it'd all be fine. 

It only makes sense if you set aside critical thinking and allow negative stereotypes of China to guide your assessment of the situation. 

The ending of the movie failed it more than any other part. The conclusion of the conflict over the aliens didn't feel plausible or even part of the same movie.

So, as I said. There are two films. One was overwrought and melodramatic. The other was underdeveloped and like the aliens themselves, could only be seen behind a foggy barrier. Only, this barrier was made of cliches, half baked secondary plots, and melodramatic interruptions in a sci-fi film to go watch Amy Adams be sad about her dead child. 

(Side note: SHE CAN SEE THROUGH TIME. She has lots of forewarning. She's a scientist, so Ian. Did they even try to dig into the problem and find doctors researching the disease and say ""hey, here's two million in grant money because I translated alien circles and I can damn well pull strings to make that happen now, why don't you start working on a cure. Now. Oh, and me and my genius husband are gonna learn every single thing about this disease and be right there with you trying to think of something."")

Overall? It's a good movie, worth the price of admission. Nothing I'd want to rewatch or tell someone to run out and buy a ticket for. It's arty and the cinematography is pretty and it's sparse so it feels like a smart high brow film, but really? It's two movies that don't taste great together.",Meg F,False,False,False,False,3.0,"Nov 08, 2016",Meg F,/user/id/975250824,RT,975250824,
4.5,"I admit that when I saw the commercials for Arrival I was like, ""yawn another let's be friends with aliens movie that's angling for an Oscar nomination"" but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie starts slow but crescendos into a fast-moving and really fascinating story of love, loss, and understanding. 

Amy Adams plays cunning linguistics (sorry I couldn't help myself) professor Dr. Louise Banks who gets drafted by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to attempt communicating with the aliens in one of the 12 pods that have landed on Earth. Dr. Banks is aided by fellow smarty-pants Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who is an astrophysicist or something science-like.

The science firm of Banks and Donnelly represent the US of A as they make their case to the alien Heptapods for why Earth is a great place filled with nothing but love and unicorns. The squid-like alien race of Heptapods look like Cthulhu or kinda like hands walking on fingers. Our home team relays their language findings to the other alien host nations, most of whom are less successful with their translating trials and super suspicious of the visiting E.T.s. Naturally Dr. Banks is able to put the pieces together and communicate with the Heptapods, but is mostly ignored by the men in the movie because of course a woman couldn't crack the secret alien code if they couldn't.   

I was sleepy and this movie still kept me awake and enthralled so it gets extra credit for that. It's a refreshingly intelligent alien movie that encourages the audience to think rather than bludgeoning them into submission with special effects.",John B,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Nov 08, 2016",John B,/user/id/840926660,RT,840926660,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1019479569/picture

5.0,"Another ""aliens making contact with Earth"" movie, Arrival is about a linguistics translator being called to try and translate an alien language from twelve unidentified objects to determine what their purpose on Earth is. Before I continue the review, I must warn you that I've specifically stayed up late at night in order to write this. Arrival is quite simply the greatest piece of cinema I have seen in recent memory. I'm tempted to say, it is on par with Gravity as my favourite sci-fi movie of all time. Damn, that was exciting to say. Now before you say I'm over-exaggerating, let me give you the reasons for this grand statement. Firstly the acting was powerful from every actor. Amy Adams deserves a nomination for this, she pulls in the emotional heft of her character whilst maintaining an intelligent persona. Jeremy Renner was also good as the witty scientist who accompanies Adams and Forest Whitaker was superb as a military colonel who has the weight of America on his shoulders. Then we go to the direction, Denis Villeneuve has yet to make a bad movie. Prisoners was flawless as a thriller. Sicario was excellent and now Arrival has just topped both of these. If he does not get a nomination for Best Director, something is clearly wrong. The way he slowly pans the camera to create tension, the way he focuses in and out of objects in the same shot, heck even the landscape shots are beautiful. Cinematography was captivating, the fact that the alien objects (that the characters refer to as 'shells') look so photorealistic that you can't determine if they are computer generated or not...is just insane. The musical score was beautiful, switching between a string arrangement for the more emotional scenes and a more sci-fi sounding tune for when the characters enter the 'shell'. It definitely pulled me in as a viewer. This brings me to best part of the film, the story. For a film involving a linguist and decoding a language, one would imagine it would be boring. Quite the opposite, I was so intrigued by the methodologies behind the linguistics and how they were used to decipher the language that it just enthralled me. There are some turns that the film takes that some might not agree with, but in my opinion they worked well. It's good to see a sci-fi film that does not insult the audience's intelligence and it's also good it does not require action to be interesting and thrilling. I could go on for hours...I really could. I've never been so happy for a film to be so good in all my life, and I can't wait to watch it again. Overall, Arrival is intriguing, beautifully composed, confidently directed and is quite simply the greatest piece of cinema in recent memory. I seriously hope everyone watches this.

3.0,"""I wish there had been more about advanced linguistics"": not a sentence you hear  every time you come out of the cinema. But that does basically highlight the movie's strength. It takes the concept of an utterly alien language and makes deciphering it if not entertaining then at least interesting. The aliens are suitably... alien, as is there method of communication. A few smaller words might have helped explain some of the high-concept material, but on the whole you understand what you need to and appreciate the cleverness of what remains. Yeah, this film does rather pat itself on the back over how clever it is. But the linguistic stuff is interesting enough. It's when the film starts to veer unexpectedly into time travel that logic and credulity go out the window. I've always hated serious films about time travel. I don't mean ones that just use time travel as a plot device, but ones that are actually about the mechanics of it. That's why Back to the Future, Part II is the worst of the series: despite some fun future hijinks it gets too involved in how everything works instead of just hand waving it away. Films that do this invariable end up being too silly, too arbitrary, or too confusing. This film is the latter with hints of the former.

This is one of those films that's easier to admire than to like. I do respect it for discussing some very advanced concepts and the sheer amount of effort that must have gone into inventing an utterly alien language and design, but at the same time it never  really grips you. I thought the opening scenes were great at showing us what it feels like to be ripped out of your mundane lives by an extraordinary event, but that's the last time they really make a serious play for your emotions as opposed to your intellect. The whole film is slow as molasses, not really doing anything for the middle section and constantly interrupting to show us Amy Adams and her doomed child.

4.0,"Arrival is a good film. It is losely adapted from Story of your life. Don't expect it to move along at a great pace its quite slow and can be off putting but stick with it. In certain places there is no dialogue its mainly just interpretation but then again that is a huge part of the story, interpreting the messages from the aliens. I enjoyed it and its certainly a film that will have you talking as you leave the cinema. It will also make you think a lot about what is happening too. It wasn't quite sure why there was flashbacks for Amy Adams character but then maybe watching it again will make that more clear. Adams and Jeremy Renner are the two leads and along with Forest Whittaker are fantastic in this movie.
I'd certainly say go see it for yourself and see what you think. I know people left the cinema halfway through and like I said the pace is very slow so I could understand that, if you stay to the end you'll understand that is about time and relativity.

4.5,"CHILDHOOD'S BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END - My Review of ARRIVAL ( 4 1/2 Stars)

Director Denis Villeneuve favors deliberate pacing in his films.  Despite trying out a variety of genres with such films as PRISONERS, SICARIO, ENEMY, and INCENDIES, he puts his stamp on them with precise visuals, haunting, quiet performances, and what seems to be his patented slow dolly-in on scenes.  In PRISONERS, for example, I felt that every scene seemed twice as long as it needed to be, but that Villeneuve's confidence in his tone made the film memorable.  His latest, ARRIVAL, firmly demonstrates that he can apply his voice to any type of story, and the results are sublime. 

Based on Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of You Life"" , screenwriter Eric Heisserer has adapted and expanded upon the science fiction tale of the appearance of 12 alien ships hovering over different locations on Earth.  Heard that one before?  Arthur C. Clarke's novel ""Childhood's End"" did it back in 1953 and without it, we wouldn't have had INDEPENDENCE DAY or DISTRICT 9.  With ARRIVAL, the influences may seem obvious, with nods to that novel as well as to INTERSTELLAR, ALIENS, TREE OF LIFE, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE ABYSS, CONTACT and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, but the Villeneuve has infused it with his own distinctive style, an intimate film about huge ideas.  

Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a preeminent professor of linguistics, who at the beginning we learn has lost a young doctor to a rare disease.  With shades of Ripley finding out about a daughter who lived an entire life while she was kicking ass out in space, this prologue sketches in just the right amount of emotional depth we need from our heroine in order to follow her on this journey.  Adams, perfectly cast here, as opposed to her role in NOCTURNAL ANIMALS, shows us Banks' bravery and vulnerability all at once in a largely nonverbal performance.  I haven't seen someone make more out of huffing and puffing since Sigourney Weaver did for Ridley Scott all those years ago. Her performance evokes strength, empathy and profound vulnerability to create a totally original, indelible character.  

With a sly feeling of inevitability, the world changes in an instant with the appearance of the aforementioned ships.  This sequence sneaks up on you with the perfect mundanity of college students getting one text after another, or when Adams walks to her car as military jets buzz overhead.  It sets the stage so perfectly that this will be a grand story told in a hushed, lovely way.  Because of her past government assignments, Banks has pre-existing security clearance which allows her to get on a helicopter right away with Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to fly to the Montana visitation site.  The economy and precision of the setup excited me in the way James Cameron's best work has done. The best of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking has made me sit up and take notice like no other films.  We're so on board with Banks, we know her Achilles Heel, and we feel confident that if anyone can talk to these aliens and find out why they're here, it's her.  

On the ride over, she meets Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a mathematician also recruited to break the aliens' coded language.  On paper, it may seem a little cheesy that we're basically given Science Vs. Language  as a source of conflict between these two characters, but I was delighted to see that the filmmakers didn't go in that direction.  Banks and Donnelly work beautifully together and establish a gentle, humorous, two-of-us-against-the-world rapport.  

And then we're there, at the base of a giant oblong disc, with Banks and company rising up into it with the help of a cherry picker.  We feel the bravery of this group of people who have no idea if the aliens come in peace or....something else.  No spoilers here but the film's second act focuses on Banks and Donnelly trying to figure out the aliens' peculiar, possibly nefarious communication style.  Like any great screenplay, there's a secret story happening underneath the main one.  In the back of our minds, we know that many plot elements remain unresolved, but it's easy to put your trust in Villeneuve and Heisserer.  Every setup pays off and every emotional truth gets explored.  

Cinematographer Bradford Young, who did such as stellar job on SELMA, has worked so well with Villeneuve to elevate this film to a true work of art. Shot after shot has the ability to surprise or unsettle the audience.  Perspectives shift often, revealing bits and pieces of the true story, and I joyfully went along for the ride. The depiction of the aliens are haunting, reminding me of the photos people take of palm trees on a foggy day in LA.  Young also captures the landscapes of Montana with such an unassuming grandeur, allowing Adams and Renner a truly lovely scene outside the ship.  It reminded me of Terrence Malick's work, where nature always seems to nudge its way into a scene.   

Adams has often come across to me as a theater arts major who made up for in spunk what she lacked in depth, but throughout her career, she has chosen roles which tap into a darker side filled with quiet rage and disappointments.  In doing so, she's accumulated 5 Oscar nominations and has become one of our most endearing, accessible actors.  When she misfires, she comes across as a little too reticent, as if her LDS upbringing has kept her from breathing real fire into her roles.  When she nails a performance, such as what she did in THE FIGHTER, it's as if she unleashed a torrent of blowsiness she had hidden from the world.  Adams' work in ARRIVAL isn't showy, and like Melanie Griffith in WORKING GIRL, she seems to always be on the verge of tears.  What's so fresh and unusual here, however, is our ability to watch a somewhat tortured soul think through tough problems.  Jodie Foster and Laura Linney have that innate ability to show us women who bare their brains before baring their souls.  Adams does both simultaneously and this film is her showcase.  Reiner offers gentle support and the rest of the cast produce nothing more than functional roles. 

For most of the running time, ARRIVAL plays out as more cerebral than emotional.  Its lack of anything cornball or Spielberg-ian works in its favor.  While dropping hints throughout the film that it possesses a real beating heart, the 11th hour revelations caught me by surprise.  Yes indeed, I got a lump in my throat as I felt the emotion and beauty of its message.  Those expecting giant alien battles and epic scope must be warned that ARRIVAL feels almost like a chamber piece, but its ideas are earth-shattering.  It left me stunned and challenging me to reflect on deep questions in my own life. It's rare that a film can bring you to such a place, and ARRIVAL, surely one of the best pictures this year, does just that.",Glenn G,False,True,False,False,4.5,"Nov 07, 2016",Glenn G,/user/id/799709308,RT,799709308,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/720603734/picture

Review by Peter Walkden (Finesse Movie Reviews)

Please note - This film has no connection to motion picture ""The Arrival"" which was released in 1996 and starred Charlie Sheen.

In case you have never heard of this film, Arrival is an alien film without the over the top action/chaos such as in films like Indepence Day. Arrival will require patience. This is a visually stunning film and I suggest to the audience to be patient and enjoy the clever and creative shots. Fans who have previously seen Sicario will be able to appreciate this director.

Lucky enough, the movie trailers for this film showed very little of what the film is about. The only tag line we have ever heard is ""Why are they here""...

The film opens up with Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) who appears to have just given birth to her daughter. We are then shown their life, progressing quickly through a moving sequence. Then we flash to present day where Louise is a expert linguist and lectures professionally.

While she is teaching a class it is soon discovered that earth will change forever. People panic when multiple spacecrafts land on earth. Louise is shortly requested to join (and lead) an elite team to investigate further.

Amy Adams provides an outstanding performance (no surprise here, duh!) but we are forced to put up with a couple of characters that really don't hold any major purpose in the film. There are many moments where I even question Jeremy Renner's role- I felt he was some what wasted as an actor.

Arrival, I must say is a top sci-fi film. As an audience we have questions from the word go and to top it off, the viewer's questions only pile up as the movie progresses. Even when the film is over you will still be thinking about it- seriously, give it the next day or two. But is that a bad thing?

After thinking about my total score for this review for a couple of days now, I'm pretty sure certain things with the film's plot (and ending) simply just don't add up. But then again, I remind myself.... it is a sci-fi film after all.

7.5/10

Arrival is now showing in Cinemas.

Cuenta de una manera pausada e inteligente la llegada misteriosa de una raza alienígena a la Tierra y cómo una lingüista (una magnífica Amy Adams) y un científico (un grandioso Jeremy Renner) intentan comunicarse con estos visitantes extraterrestres para comprender el propósito de su visita.
El enfoque de ""Arrival"" no es bélico ni tecnológico: es un enfoque comunicativo (semiótico y lingüístico) que a su vez explora el fenómeno del tiempo. El resultado es una película dirigida magistralmente por Denis Villeneuve, quien con sus obras ""Incendies"", ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"" y ""Sicario"" nos ha demostrado, al igual que Christopher Nolan, que el cine de género y el cine experimental no tienen por qué oponerse.
""Arrival"" es una película formalmente bella (que evoca los trabajos de Terrence Malick), con una banda sonora impresionante a cargo de Jóhan Jóhansson y una fotografía imponente a cargo de Bradford Young (""Selma""). Y presenta un giro que no solo tiene que ver con la historia relatada sino con el lenguaje del cine mismo.

The movie is very confusing and even more hard to follow.  A tremendous waste of very talented cast.

The revelation here is Villeneuve, who expands on the symphonic pacing showcased last year in the drug war drama Sicario. Even though the concept of Arrival is far-out fiction, Villeneuve treats it with no less detail or urgency.

A Spielberg-Nolan lovechild of sorts, wondrous and mind-bending in equal parts, Denis Villeneuve's latest is a quintessential science-fiction blockbuster steeped in genre traditions and made singular by Amy Adams's transporting performance.

Arrival may offer a few too many metaphors to keep some viewers engaged. But it's guaranteed to stick in your mind a fair amount longer than, say, Men in Black 3.

It's remarkable how far Villeneuve, too, has travelled -- from minor but impressive Quebec features to big-budget filmmaking that's turned mainstream genre-fare into thrilling, atmosphere-rich cinema.

Brian Gibson
Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)
The film is not a colourful one, with suitably muted cinematography and a sense of realism many such stories eschew. Maybe that's not the best news for the box-office but it makes for a more intelligent movie of the genre all the same.

Cliches aside, the film proves to be a smart thriller--and unexpectedly so. Adams is great, per usual.

 1/2
I guess it doesn't take much to make an amazing movie. Just an incredibly original story by Ted Chiang, great directorial choices by Dennis Villeneuve, and a great performance from Amy Adams. The film's pragmatic approach to an alien landing really separates it from other sci-fi films, and then the story hits another gear and separates itself from all other films of any genre. A couple of pacing holes are present but can't come close to bringing this movie down. I have always believed the best films are the ones that have you thinking well after you've left the theater. This is one of those films.

Your enjoyment of this film probably depends on how you deal with the reveal of the underlying concept. You could call that a twist, although the hints are there throughout. In the film's own logic all that makes perfect sense and makes for an ending both unsettling and deeply satisfying. The cinematography and production design as well as the music set the tone, but it is Adams' great performance that carries the film. A smart, beautiful, engaging and optimistic Sci-Fi-movie that will make you think for days.

Like the very best type of science fiction, Villeneuve's astounding masterpiece is not only brilliant in terms of structure and narrative but is above all else a profound philosophical exploration of human condition that makes us reflect on the beauty of communication, memory and love.

Spoiler Alert
-----------------------

The whole point of this movie, the whole driving conflict was the question ""what are these aliens doing here?"". We get a kind of sort of answer on this at the crisis action but then spend the rest of the last 3rd of the movie tying up various subplots that snuck themselves into the movie. The problem is, during these subplot resolutions, we are totally neglecting the main conflict which is still, why SPECIFICALLY are these aliens here. We get the vague answer ""we need humanity's help in 3000 years so we came here to give you the power to see the future"". And YET we have no indication that Louise Banks (Amy Adams) shares her new found future telling powers with anybody or that this revelation was communicated anywhere. We don't know how being able to tell the future helps the Aliens in 3000 years (presumably they already have this ability) and what specifically they need help with. The entire juice of conflict resolution was taken out the plot.

I eventually watched it towards the end of its stay in theaters, and wow was I impressed. Denis does a masterful job of crafting this beautiful film showing the bigger picture and bringing up the possibility of extraterrestrial life having a different motive for arriving. I thought the language aspect was brilliant and brought a fresh flavor to the alien genre, and Amy Adams is powerful in her role. It is honestly a shock that Adams wasn't nominated for neither this film or Nocturnal Animals, but I digress.

I felt that the pace made the movie drip with tension and when matched with some awesome visuals, it became a genuinely unique experience at the theater.  I will admit that I only partially understood the ending of Arrival.  I had to Google it when I got home.  But I now realize that I should have understood it; I just needed to pay more attention.

When mysterious spacecrafts touch down across the globe, an elite team - lead by expert linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) - is brought together to investigate.

It presents many clues without revealing its hidden truth until the film's shocking conclusion.

Instead I got all of that, plus a completely unique twist that I have never seen attempted and I'm not sure ever will be attempted again, at least for a while, (you know Hollywood). It was an incredibly bold idea from Villeneuve but it paid off, this was a unique experience and I thank him for that. Amy Adams gives one of her best ever performances and Villeneuve really took time to romanticise her character but he did it subtly instead of trying to force it. My only real fault with the film is Jeremy Renner's character because he isn't really needed up there if Amy Adams goes up there. I still liked his character and his performance but I just felt his character was unnecessary for what they were doing. I have already mentioned how well directed this is and Villeneuve holds the suspense beautifully, the score is enchanting. The visual effects are very good too but you'd expect that from a big budget film like this one.

3.5,"Arrival is a tough one for me. It's probably the first social realism/alien invasion mashup movie ever made, and kudos for that. Amy Adams is always pretty, pretty believable and relatable. It's fascinating to consider the communication angle to the eclipsing of all other considerations (action sequences, technology, spacey stuff). There is also a really intriguing commentary on free-will, predestination and foreknowledge. So far, so excellent.
But... Jeremy Renner is a craggy, cratery Tommy Lee Jones Jr, but he is a bit of a spare part in this, along with Forrest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg (who reminds me of a charisma-free Bradley Whitford). The aliens themselves are a bit annoying as they are shrouded in fog, literally and metaphorically. A lot of people have criticised the somewhat rushed uses of deus ex machina. And although the idea of the film is genius in principle, I found the execution (along with the omni-grey colour palette) to be dull in the first half, and I actually nodded off in places.

3.5,"Fresh out of Odeon Leicester Square after a 9AM screening and, despite some beautiful moments, I'm left with a familiar sense of disappointment with the big budget Sci-Fi movies of recent years. There's no doubt this has some thought provoking moments and an originality to the look and feel of the 'visitors'. There's a heart-rendering subplot and twist which adds a different ingredient. However, visually, so much is familiar with this genre, borrowed from the Sci-Fi classics - from the textures, to the technology, to the sound design - that it's hard to see originality for too long. Amy Adams' performance is strong and weighty, but secondary characters such as Forest Whitaker's are thin, with poor, stereotypical military dialogue and weak lines of questioning (illustrated in his first scene when the audience laughed at his 'serious' question). All too often these days, the thought provoking Sci-Fi movie descends into overcomplicating the story before warring nations, faux news reports and Chinese generals enter the fray to take us back to Independence Day. Sensitively filmed, good performances by the leads, strong music, but too much 'story' and Hollywood cliche crammed in left me realising I spent just under two hours watching what I've watched before.",Adam W,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Oct 10, 2016",Adam W,/user/id/551723326,RT,551723326,
4.0,"Arrival is that science fiction film that you would like it or hate it when it comes to the ending. Amy Adams does give an outstanding performance as Louise, a linguist that has to work for the government. When several alien spacecraft hovers above in several continents. The spacecrafts are at standstill. At certain time, the alien are trying to communicate using their language symbols. Louise and Ian (Jeremy Renner) are trying to solve the mystery with the aliens purpose on earth before the government and other world leaders decide to face against them using weapons. Are the alien species the real threat? Or is there a hidden purpose? 

Arrival is a stunning film. Denis Villeneuve direction is remarkable yet again. Especially with his work from films like Prisoners and Sicario. Denis can create a suspenseful tone and the build up towards the climax. The plot works with the less you know about it. May not be an action packed alien invasion movie. More of a character human study as how would governments react when they have an unknown spacecrafts flying over their lands. And unable to communicate with them without giving the wrong message. The ending does give a lot to think about and may frustrate others or be something to talk about. I think it works well with the hidden message that its trying to portray. The music composer Johann Johannson was beautiful and haunting in the film. 

My only issue with the film is the pace. It is slow moving and does slow down when characters are going up to communicate with the aliens and coming back down to study their language and figure out what the symbols mean. It does get repetitive for a while and slow.

4.0,"I actually did get more out of this than 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario'
director Denis Villeneuve this time tackles the sci-fi genre 
it's a terrific character-driven flick with a bigger emphasis on the science of it all
Amy Adams gives a truly remarkable performance as a linguistics professor called in to investigate the sudden appearance of several alien spacecraft around the globe
she says language is the foundation of civilization, it's the easiest way to create conflict among one another
she also works among Donelly (Jeremy Renner) and Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to get some legitimate answers
the film signifies this event as a way for humanity to come together and forget all of our petty differences
the two big questions everyone wants answered: why are they here what is their purpose?
the film is a cool slow-burner making us ponder the real reason the aliens have come; are they explorers? are they here to help? or are they more sinister than we're led to believe?
the other trouble is that Villeneuve has us open our eyes in that language in itself is more tricky than we know, the wrong translation or interpretation can come across as friendly or potentially hostile
that's why Louise urges her team to realize that there is a big difference between a tool and a weapon
if the history of mankind has taught us anything it's that sometimes it can be viewed as both plus the whole world has no single leader making it impossible to follow several others
the movie also flashes back and forward covering Louise's traumatized past of losing her daughter to what essentially could be the key to finding out the visitors' true intentions
the ending is a bit of a stretch but the rest of the film builds such dramatic tension while also delivering fascinating visuals
I think it's also a realistic portrayal of how we as a species would react to such a phenomenal occurrence such as this
some are on board with the idea of first contact, others choose the route of fear even violence 
all in all it's communication that determines who we are and how things transpire from there

4.0,"The screen adaptation of the acclaimed story, by Ted Chiang, is an atmospheric sci-fi mystery with ambition. The rare example of hollywood production where special effects serve the plot and not the other way round. Forget about the demolished metropolises and the White House reduced to ashes with a laser. Most of the action takes place in several rooms and the main character,  nonstop, experiences extrasensory phenomena.

Louise Banks (Amy Adams), an appreciated linguist is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. But our heroine doesn't have much time. Mankind - according to the rule ""shoot first, think second"" - hangs by the thread of global war. As the world submerges itself in madness (which can be seen in television broadcasts), Louise along with physicist Ian (Jeremy Renner) and Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) tries to communicate with heptapods.

Scenes, when the main character views the extraterrestial spacecraft and later explores it, are the examples of a top class cinema. The director Denis Villeneuve once again reaffirms us that he is unmatched when it comes to appalling the audience and filling the screen with terron. Touched by a family drama, Louise is another - after Kate Macer in ""Sicario"" - strong female, forced to find her place in the world run by men. The doctor isn't just the passive observer. She is not affraid of taking risk and questioning wrong decisions made by superiors. As the plot goes, it turns out that the potential threat to the humanity are not only aliens, but humans themselves.

Villeneuve is one of the most talented and visionary directors - a great pick for the next ""Blade Runner"". He reaches fo screenplays from which, peers out profundity and gracious form. ""Arrival"" does not lack intriguing ideas and aspirations through which, it shows a substantial essence of human nature and modern world. What sets this film apart from others in the genre is the way it approaches the problem of loss and fear. The thing that is escalated by the great performance from Amy Adams.

And it doesn't end here. What's left is, the crucial to the film, relativity of time - a real minefield of spoilers.

5.0,"I cried in a movie. Yes, I, who have not cried in a movie in at least six or seven years, cried in a movie. That happened. Arrival delivered one of the most thoughtful, well-directed, well-shot, and unexpected cinematic experiences I have ever seen. It's an experience I won't forget, and it's an experience I recommend to any thinking moviegoer out there. Here's why.

Arrival is a science-fiction film directed by Dennis Villeneuve, the acclaimed filmmaker behind last year's action thriller Sicario. It stars Amy Adams as a prestigious linguist, who is brought in by the American government to assist in their dealings with the appearance of twelve disc-shaped UFOs that have landed across the planet. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker co-star as a theoretical scientist and an American Army colonel, respectively. First, I'll mention the most obvious great things about the movie: the acting, to start. In Arrival, Amy Adams delivers one of the most emotional, compelling performances of her career. She portrays someone who is easy to sympathize with and someone who is broken due to events in her past, and she owns the movie with the passion that she puts into her character.

There are several other things in the film that stood out to me that don't typically stand out in movies. For instance, it delivered some incredible cinematography, with many breathtaking shots of the UFOs and very carefully filmed scenes that highlight little details and plot points that become important as the plot progresses. The sound editing and sound quality also blew me away: the soundtrack accompanying the introduction of the UFOs and the aliens, the chilling, electrified hums that became common with shots of Adams' and Renner's characters inside the ships, and even the deafening sounds heard with jets and helicopters early on in the movie; they were all things that enhanced Arrival even further beyond its incredible quality.

Now, my favorite part of the film, and probably the part that distinguishes Arrival from the many sci-fi films that have come before it, is the writing and the thoughtfulness of the plot. Even from the beginning, there were things about the story that impressed me. Aliens in popular culture tend to be portrayed as evil, destructive beings who seek the destruction of humanity. Indepedence Day, Alien, Skyline, Battle: Los Angeles, War of the Worlds... these are all very stereotypical alien flicks that portray extraterrestrials in the same light. They're unrealistic, corny, repetitive. This is the first way that Arrival distinguishes itself: it focuses on what could ACTUALLY happen upon the appearance of aliens in our world: it very realistically portrays how world governments would probably deal with that sort of situation, and how the public response would follow, influenced by media and panic. I also loved how it focused on something BESIDES the action, destruction, and military of most alien movies. Instead, it showed how a linguist and team of scientists would attempt to peacefully communicate with a race beyond our world.

However, the most fantastic part of this movie is something I can't discuss in depth without spoiling things. Arrival introduces pieces of a puzzle as the plot progresses and thickens, and as the movie progresses, it makes you think. A LOT. It makes you think about how those pieces fit together. It makes you think about life beyond us, our culture, our world, and humanity in general. As I said in the beginning, it's a film for the thinking moviegoer. Arrival made me think, and I had to discuss it with my friend for half an hour after it ended to digest everything and satisfy my thoughts. I loved it. And above all, it was emotional. Like I said, I cried. The movie's conclusion made me an emotional wreck, due to the investment I felt in the characters and the sympathy I shared with them.

Arrival surprised me in ways I couldn't imagine. It went in completely unexpected directions, and I was blown away by the conclusion. Tears were rightfully shed, and I struggled after its conclusion with the possibility of replacing Gravity with Arrival as my #1 favorite movie of all time. And that's because Arrival is truly amazing. I recommend it to any thoughtful person, science fiction fan, or movie fanatic out there. It's one of my favorite movies ever, and it's the most well-earned five stars that I've given a movie in a while.",Paul F,False,True,False,False,5.0,"Oct 04, 2016",Paul F,/user/id/973387434,RT,973387434,

2.5,"Before I give my thoughts on Arrival, I want to share an amusing anecdote.

2 and a half minutes before the movie was over (yes, somebody timed it) the fire alarm went off because of a kitchen incident at the connected P.F. Chang's. We all had to evacuate. But when we got back in they gave us free passes and let us see the end of the movie right where it left off!

Arrival was good. The mystery and suspense was great, and the reveal was cool. That being said, there is no emotion in this movie. Seriously, it's like a Vulcan wrote the screenplay. Pure logic. OK, there is emotion, but it all comes from the news on TV, Skype calls, and people on the phone. Aside from being nervous/afraid, everybody on screen is a blank slate.

And even when exciting things happen, the very next scene brushes it aside and deals with it off screen. Literally, after something major happens, one of the characters says ""Oh yeah, it was just [two nameless guys]."" and that's it! Nothing but the main event holds any weight!

So if you want good suspense and don't mind the lack of emotion and dealing with major events off screen, check out Arrival. Just be prepared.

5.0,"More and more, every year, especially in the late Fall into Winter, there are movies that are released that have a message or agenda, sometimes hidden, usually not. Often these movies are described or intended to be marketed as ""Oscar Buzz Movies"" I'm not saying that promoting action or change is a bad thing, I'm just saying these things exist. Sometimes the message is diversity or social justice, sometimes it's a comment on political corruption or journalistic integrity. Whatever it is its almost a lock that a movie will get recognized for it.

This year, a movie called Arrival demonstrated a message that called for its audience to, for once, don't speak, just listen. In an era of global communication through countless channels, we sometimes take for granted our ability to understand one another.   More than ever people are told they have a voice and they have a platform and they need to use it, and while in moderation that can be true.  However, the ability to listen and objectively think, to proceed with caution instead of just attacking with what you think is right, that notion is losing ground. More than anything else the ideas of listening, thinking, and understanding before acting is what the movie Arrival is about. Science Fiction has a way of molding philosophy, like clay, in a way that we can use our imaginations to better understand ideas. While the movie isn't perfect (Jeremy Renner's character is basically a plot device and some of the conflicts seem forcefully thrown in without any real catalyst) as a whole, Arrival is the most optimistic and imaginative movie I saw this year.

5.0,"Don't mind the people giving this movie a 1 or 2 star rating. People who lack the capacity to understand this movie should not be trusted in their review because this movie is in no way confusing or incoherent if you just pay attention. Arrival will not babysit the viewer and doesn't mind taking its time to develop it's characters and plot in proper fashion. On top of this, the writing is spectacular, from how Amy Adams character explains and conveys every little nuance in the writing and language to how there is a complete disconnect between Amy Adams character, a teacher, and the uptight government agent types. The cinematography is some of the best this year and this movie knows how to establish a proper opening shot. From the beautiful vistas spanning Montana's mountains, to the close up and personal shots of Amy Adams character's house, this movie uses its visuals to help tell its story in a capacity I've seen in few other movies this year achieve. To fully understand Arrival, the viewer must pick up on small clues laced throughout the movie that ultimately come together to give one of the most compelling and satisfying revelations in a movie this year, or any other year for that matter. This movie is a thinking man's movie, much in the same vain of movies like 2001, and it must be seen to be understood. Just give it a try with an open mind and your full attention. If you're looking for a fast passed action film, then this isn't the film for you. But I would hardly say the movie is ever boring. Slow? At times. Boring? It's really up to you to decide.

3.5,"ok, i enjoyed the movie... however, i expected it to be so ""universal"" in it's very simple message. The cinematography was good, acting was good(even though I am not a huge Amy Adams fan and Renners character was pretty pointless), story was fine, and the message... well, the message was pretty cliche. The message was no different from Independence Day or the Avengers... the world must unite and work together to defeat a possible threat outside of ourselves(in this case, through communicating with one another). It spoke somewhat on freewill and the concept of fatalism, yet kept the story so much on the surface, I really felt like there was little to delve underneath, to give the film any depth. All the depth was on the surface, which pushed cliche, and there was nothing really underneath to chew on after the film.
The time travel concept, which i guess was the ""wow factor"" of the film, was done better in Memento... and the ""open your eyes"" concept, was touched on much more intelligently, in 2001: A Space Odyssey... and the symbolism, which i expected to be extremely rich in the film, as Denis' previous films, was unbelievably light to the touch(his past film Enemy was ripe with symbolism and thought... and handled much in the same was as Arrival, but done with a stronger hand, and less on the nose).

I cannot speak enough praise for the heights in beautiful cinematography, narrative pacing, intelligence, universal relevance and raw emotion this film achieved. Arrival is the thinking man's Sci-Fi epic. In Lieu of action set pieces and high octane thrills (don't get me wrong I love that shit when it's done properly) but Arrival uses it's intellect and philosophy to it's advantage with flawless execution. This film speaks volumes in very blatant but also very subtle ways and this is a film that needs to be seen. Arrival carries a heavy weight of universal relevance and uses its narrative to stir up issues we face not as a specific nationality, nor an individual country but as a species as a whole and is also one of the most well thought out and emotional narratives I have seen in recent memory.

5.0,"What a remarkable movie. It is one of the few times where I believe the source material is expounded upon and improved in the film. Amy Adams is astounding, and this I hope, is her breakout performance. The film does a remarkable job of letting the audience figure it out, and you really feel more accomplished as a film goer than having them spell everything out for you. It's a really powerful introspection into life, love, time, and our existence. But never does the film spell out how you should feel about these things, rather it shows you that we only have our interpretations of them, and it is up to us to do with that as we will. The film also is powerful not in it's action or violence, rather in its lack of action. It truly is the most innovative and intelligent science fiction film that we've had in a long time. It's a slow burner, and there are pacing issues toward the end of the film, but overall this is not only one of the best films of the year, but probably of the decade.

5.0,"A brilliant piece of sci-fi, Arrival is an ambitious, intelligent and consuming movie which will provoke you with its concept, stun you with its aesthetic attention to details and keep you thinking over what you have just seen long after the final credits. Emotionally loaded and terrifically acted, this latest Denis Villeneuve masterpiece is also a philosophical take on the limits of human understanding and personal choice turning this movie into the best sci-fi delivery since Interstellar. 
Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is an elite linguist who is asked to lead a team of top scientist after the arrival of 12 UFOs on earth. Tasked with the unthinkable mission of establishing first contact with the a mysterious alien vessel and creatures, Dr. Banks has to co-operate with Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and Colonel Weber (Forest Whitake) and delivery quick answers amidst the constantly escalating international tensions.
First  and most importantly, Arrival is not the mainstream sci-fi action thriller, which relies on the concept of alien invasion and all in military actions. Restrained and very intimate at moments , it is not only a scientific mission, but also a personal journey of Doctor Banks. A journey which will lead to a challenging philosophical exploration on the limits of communication and human condition. 
Typically for director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners, Sicario), the pacing is slow and yet the tension build-up is steady and leads to a twist which will open space for much more questions rather than to provide you easy answers. Amy Adams succeeds to be a convincing centre of Villeneuve's exploration of human mind and perception to an extend in which not only the philosophical part of movie, but also the emotional one will stun you in the end. 
In conclusion, Arrival is another masterpiece by the talented Canadian Denis Villeneuve which could easily be considered one of the best movies of 2016.

4.0,"Quick Review: Denis Villenueve for those who've known me decently enough know is someone that I consider maybe one of my all time favourite up and coming filmmakers right up to par with Christopher Nolan; In that they're people who put as much time into whether storytelling, emotions, and heart to their craft more so than the stunning filmmaking that goes with it. Since Incendies i've seen Villenueve really create his craft vert meticulously and so effortlessly that, it really makes me wonder how a film like this with a relative medium budget and earns 100 MILLION overall doesn't wake up more filmmakers to branch their films on this scope than keeping to the same IP's. Whatever the case may be, Arrival was certainly one of the films back in 2016 I mean to watch on the biggest screen I can, but due to its overbooking I decided to wait on watching it. Now that I have, WOW was that certainly a wait well worth spent, because Arrival certainly delivers on a solid adaptation to Ted Chiangs short story and has a lot that really makes it well defined on its own.

Minus perhaps some plot points (specifically with the introduction to how Louise is asked to join when Colonel Weber goes to her office and with some issue with the end of how oddly convenient its set up and kind of ends a bit with a weak payoff) being tweaked somewhat and with the occasion wish they'd add just a little more of seeing Louie's story go on, I must say the film really just shines thanks to its amazing directing by Denis Villenueve who before the cusp of Blade Runner 2049 this made the journey to that SO MUCH more satisfying to see work his craft so flawlessly, beautiful and really atmospheric cinematography from Bradford Young that can really get him some work done after, must be noted really creative and welt built iconography and sets for both locations and especially the alien ship that really help give it this feel and look that gives its honour to the source material, super solid writing from Eric Heisserer who really knows how to pace and balance his story and dialogue and arcs and themes for someone being the only one doing the adaptation, terrific performances from just about everyone and obviously the bigger highlight of Amy Adams who as always manages to give herself character with each performance, and holy shit the score by Johan Johansson being JAW droppingly limited but so freaking well done and subtle that it makes me wish and wonder what prevented him from doing Blade Runner 2049's score (and oh shit as of writing this I forgot he passed away, rest in peace his soul he was a fine composer). So overall I think its safe to say this was a pretty great watch first time around, and definitely looking back before the wow factor of BR2049 this was definitely the right stepping stone to direct a film like that, and im glad it could be Denis; proud of him.

4.5,"Arrival is a drastic change of pace from the average alien invasion film we see nowadays. This isn't a big action blockbuster about alien invasion but instead a story about trying to communicate with the aliens and understand their purpose. The film is incredibly well made and is a ingeniously crafted story. Amy Adams is in the lead role and she's excellent. Her character is very well written and she has a lot to her, Adams does a superb job at playing her and it's one of her best in a very long time. Jeremy Renner is very good, it's a different role for him and his character is very interesting also especially by the end. Forrest Whitaker is good also though his character is a cliche. The film is directed by Dennis Villeneuve, who previously directed Prisoners and Sicario. He does a fantastic job here as this is an incredibly interesting film with lots of twists and turns that advance the film instead of making it stupid. The ending of this film is brilliant and will make you look back on the rest of the film. It really is a movie that will be a completely different experience if you watch it again. The film is very well written also. The screenplay is very tight and intricate and luckily there aren't too many plot holes. This film is a technical masterpiece. The cinematography by Bradford Young is spectacular, the movie looks amazing and the shots of the aliens themselves really are beautiful. The musical score by Jóhaan Jóhannsson is also amazing, it's tense but also beautiful at the same time. The films ending as I mentioned is fantastic and has an absolutely superb twist. It's one of those twists that completely changes the rest of the film and makes everything click into place. Now while this is a superb film I do have a couple of problems. As I mentioned with the exception of Adams and Renners' character all the others are massive cliches. Also some aspects of the films ending are a bit predictable. However Arrival is an extremely well made and clever movie. It's a brilliant new spin on the first contact sub genre and further cements how brilliant Dennis Villeneuve is as a director. I can't wait to see what he does with Blade Runner 2049 because he is a fantastic director. A",Ben  T,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 01, 2016",Ben  T,/user/id/962485919,RT,962485919,

4.0,"Villeneuve's latest effort solidifies him as one of the most interesting talents working in mainstream cinema. He takes this high concept sci-fi premise and explores it without dumbing it down, but giving enough to comprehend, all while developing a fascinating lead character that serves as the films emotional anchor. 
The way the narrative developes feels fresh and is exalted by the tension and atmosphere created by the outstanding sound design and the beautiful cinematography, both which play with perspective and scale, enthralling in an almost visceral way.

4.5,"Arrival is a rarity not just in regards to its content and execution, but in terms of what's included in a mainstream movie. Although being marketed as more of a typical thriller, here we have what is, at its core, much more of an art film--but that doesn't make it any less engaging. Denis Villenueve's latest has more of his steady direction in a dreamy, layered, and beautiful meditation on the progression and uncertainty of life, and with its unorthodox structure, it's very well fit for a repeat viewing. Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a linguist and college professor who is brought to Montana by the United States after 12 extraterrestrial ships, which look like giant floating onyx beans, come to various locations across the world. She works with Ian (Jeremy Renner), a physicist, and two attempt to understand why the aliens have arrived and what they want, trying to understand their language and science. What turned out to be a pleasant surprise is that all of this is really a backdrop to the real core of the film, which is about life, time, and growth. It's based on a story called ""Story of Your Life"" written by Ted Chiang, but the real surprise is that the screenplay was written by Eric Heisserer, who wrote movies such as Final Destination 5 and Lights Out and co-wrote the awful 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. He really brings something special to the table here, taking a rather overexposed premise and placing the scope on its protagonist with a very intimate look at her and her life. I won't spoil anything, but the way that the movie uses its structure to manipulate the viewer and reveal more and more about the main character is surprising and satisfying. We begin the movie just by seeing Louise's profession and her losing her young daughter to cancer, but there's much more in how the plot unravels. It reminded me of Donnie Darko in a way, and the way that Heisserer presents his themes are fittingly aloof, but that adds to the intrigue and gives them a greater effect. With its nonlinear structure, it's one of those films that will have a noticeably different effect upon a second viewing, and smartly enough, that in and of itself plays into the film's themes regarding knowledge, progress, and time. The filmmaking is also a great fit for the material. This kind of stuff is in Villenueve's (versatile) wheelhouse, allowing him to bring his dark yet fantastical mood to the world of the film. It's far more Enemy than Sicario both in terms of the execution and the artsiness of it, and there will be people put off by that, but Villenueve's direction makes it accessible enough without compromising its artistic integrity. Adams is always great to watch, but she really brings a vulnerability and strength to her character in non-obvious ways. The movie looks absolutely beautiful from its use of fog and colors as well as long takes and environments. The spaceship that Louise and Ian go into several times to communicate with the aliens is pristine and minimalist, and the design of the aliens are also interesting--they look sort of look octopi mixed with tarantulas. The sound work done with the aliens' noises present some great sound work. There are two minor issues with Arrival, though, and ironically, both of them have to do with the script. One is that Renner's character is a little underdeveloped and I can't tell if that was intentional or not. I could see why it would have been a specific choice, but I'm not sure that it came through. The other is that there's one moment in the film that seemed a bit irrelevant to the film overall; maybe more could have been done with it. Nonetheless, Arrival is one of the best movies of 2016 so far, and it's great to see a movie this big have so much going on beneath the surface. There's a little Stanley Kubrick, a little Jonathan Glazer, and a little Terrance Malick, but it still feels original and the movie won't leave you after you leave the theater. 8.8/10, terrific, A-, far above average, etc.",Matt C,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Sep 01, 2016",Matt C,/user/id/905085554,RT,905085554,

4.5,"Even after Amy Adams' abysmal performances as Lois Lane in the past few years' worth of horrid DC comic movies, director Denis Villenueve had already sold anything he was ever going to do the minute I walked out of last year's ""Sicario"". Fortunately, when given a real character to work with, Adams knocks it out of the Montana valley in which this film is set. Blending a monolithic hard sci-fi a la ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with the emotional depth that characterizes Villenueve's oevre, ""Arrival"" is so much more than just the plot or the visuals.For the film's ""Independence Day"" meets ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" overtones, (without going into spoilers) the film isn't about that, surprisingly. It touches on a lot of similar themes as ""Interstellar"" in that there is some sort of multidimensional ""love transcends time"" deus ex machina. It might seem like that's it, but it's really more about the necessity of communication, the ambiguous nature of language, and one's ability to choose their future. A small gripe I have with the movie is that Forest Whitaker's character is at first vehemently against bringing Amy Adams to the extraterrestrial ""shell"" because he thinks she's just manipulating her way on board a space craft. But he would have to take her to the site anyway to do any meaningful linguistic analysis of the alien language, plus Whitaker just plays a run of the mill gruff army type which doesn't really do him justice as an actor. But the stark beauty of the film and the emotive performances otherwise make up for any shortcomings.

3.5,"""Quebec's own Denis Villeneuve has crafted a fine sci-fi thriller that's challenging, involving  and imaginative""
Movie Review: Arrival
Date Viewed: November 16 2016
Directed By Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners and Sicario)
Screenplay By Eric Heisserer, Based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang
Starring: Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Mark O'Brien and Tzi Ma.

""Arrival"" plays with it's ideas thoughtfully but it's not as groundbreaking as I imagined it would be. Still, this is another home run for Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario) and Amy Adams delivers one of her best performances. It's another alien invasion story but this sci-fi epic is more about communication, mystery and suspense than just your usual slam-bang action. The screenplay by Eric Heisserer (A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) and Lights Out) is challenging and thought-provoking and this movie has echoes to sci-fi classics like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".

It is far from being a great movie but the intensity of it and it's ingenious ideas are hard to ignore here. Villeneuve has crafted a fine sci-fi thriller that's exceptional and imaginative. ""Arrival"" stars Adams as Louise Banks, a linguist who gets assigned by the U.S. Army to join a team of scientific experts in unraveling the mysterious events that are occurring around the world. They are talking about the 12 cocoon-look-a-like extraterrestrial spaceships that have emerged all across the continents.

On the verge of starting a war of the worlds, Banks and theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) get assigned by General GT Weber (Forest Whitaker) to go inside the spacecrafts and see if they can communicate with the octopus-like aliens which they call ""heptapods"". Before the alien invasion, Louise Banks was a single mother to her daughter but she tragically died from cancer.

The Chinese and the Russians are already communicating with the aliens, from a show of military power but Louise has had success in communicating with them by showing up and again and again and by knowing the alien translations. The aliens communicate with her and Ian by revealing circular symbols to the glass which is separating them from the humans. Louise gets to ask them ""What do you want?"" and they say ""offer weapon"". What does it mean? Could it be a sign of a show of force or a tool in helping them with their spacecrafts? However, the media and the news sites are dubbing it as ""use weapon"" and military and political leaders around the world start to freak out as they prepare themselves for possible invasion.

Many of my fellow critics are already calling ""Arrival"" another sci-fi breakthrough and one of the best movies of the year but again I have to challenge them. Is there anything here that's beyond original? No. Nevertheless, the acting here is terrific.
The performances from Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are how can I put this: Out of this world!

Again, it's not as ambitious as I was hoping for it to be and it could've been something more but thanks to fine actors, compelling drama and great special effects, ""Arrival"" is one of the more entertaining blockbusters this holiday season.",Patrick L,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Aug 27, 2016",Patrick L,/user/id/942439004,RT,942439004,

The performance and technical aspects really do hit home, keeping the audience on the edge through the entire film, and has reliable Renner and Forrest Whittiker in supporting roles. The intriguing thing is what to take a way from the end moments and the somewhat cirrcular arc in a way of the film since by learning the language Amy Adams seems to be able to forecast the future eriely, so the normative arc or establishing beginnings and ends are a little heh?

4.5,"Time and time again, Denis Villeneuve proves that he will not let you down. This man has yet to make a bad or even sub-par film. Arrival left me speechless, literally -- me and my buddy didn't say anything for about 2 minutes after the credits rolled. We just sat and pondered about what we had witnessed. I have never felt this way about a sci-fi film since Interstellar (another thought provoking genre film that evoked true human emotion albeit less successfully). 

There's something about this film that keeps you on your toes. Whether it's Villeneuve's mysterious directing style that unfolds right in front of you or perhaps the structure of the narrative itself, everything is held together by Amy Adams who puts on a show. This movie would not have worked without her leading the charge time and time again. 

On a final note, I think this is one of the best and most realized sci-fi films I've ever seen. Parts of it reminded me of Interstellar, and other parts District 9. Those are 2 of my favorite films in the canon, and Arrival is right there with them -- except Arrival is one of the best films of the year (if not the best I've seen so far). It's truly an unbelievable and deft blend of thought-provoking themes and actual human emotion that speaks to the dispersive nature of humanity as well as language's ability to unite and mend our differences. Fantastic movie.

5.0,"Arrival is directed by Denis Villeneuve, and it stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker in a science-fiction film about alien spacecrafts that come on to earth, but they haven't done anything yet but stand there, and the military come to Louise Banks (Amy Adams) for help as she's the best linguist that they have got for her to understand the aliens about why are they here, what their purpose is, and if they are friendly or not. Seeing as the Academy Awards are over and we finally know what film won Best Picture, I decide to go on a route of watching films that were nominated for Best Picture. There are definitely going to be some times that I watch something else and review it, but I'll try to watch all of them in that category, and with this, Arrival is one of the films I was most excited about of 2016 as I enjoyed Denis Villeneuve's work like Prisoners and Enemy, and with his next work being Blade Runner 2049 after this, I was curious to see how he can handle science-fiction, which I believe he did a bang up job on it. Amy Adams gave a great performance given from what she has to do whether it be her horrific backstory, or that she's really tired dealing with world stuff. It's cool to see that we actually have no idea about whether the aliens are friendly or not because this is Denis Villeneuve's first science-fiction film, so it's not quite a certain to where it's leading until later on. There's also the short story by Ted Chiang called ""Story of Your Life"", but I haven't read it, and even if there's a clue about it as Eric Heisserer wrote horror films like Final Destination 5 and Lights Out, it still has that mystery feel that is unpredictable. It's also interesting that writer Eric Heisserer wanted to get this made for years, and finally got the dream that he wanted, while also some rewrites from producer Dan Levine and even the director himself. With that on topic, the writing by Eric Heisserer is probably the most well-written that I've seen from him as it deals with the themes of the film very well, and asks questions that you don't usually see in a science-fiction film, and manages to answer them in a way that is very satisfying. It is also the main part of the film as it's a talky flick and it doesn't have any action scenes, so it's only the dialogue that you have to be invested in it, and for me, I was intrigued enough in the movie. The score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is well-orchestrated that has some beautiful music to listen that felt poetic with what the movie needed, especially towards the ending. It's very smart that it shows that you can get lots of progress from a linguist that I have never heard of until now. The effects look spectacular that has a great blend of practical and computer effects from the design of the spacecraft, the aliens, and even the language that the aliens speak which has a lot more variety then I thought. I was also glad that some of the characters wasn't going to the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" approach which is refreshing to watch when seeing movies like Independence Day: Insurgence. The cinematography by Bradford Young is really good that I thought that Roger Deakins did it, but since he wasn't the one, but is doing Blade Runner 2049 which also has the same director as this, it's interesting to see where that is going to lead. With that said, Arrival is just a beautiful film that I understand why it was nominated of Best Picture, and this might be the one where the director's finally going to be recognizable.",Brandon W,False,False,False,False,5.0,"Aug 23, 2016",Brandon W,/user/id/912949741,RT,912949741,

This is genuinely the most enjoyable cinema experience I have had since Interstellar, and placing it as my second favourite film of all time was one of the easiest decisions I have made recently.

3.5,"In an era where every space oriented movie comes out in the fall of every year (i.e Gravity October of 2013, Interstellar November of 2014, The Martian October of 2015) we have Arrival another epic sic fi movie that came out in November of 2016 not saying its bad just wanted to point that out, now without further ado lets review Arrival:

Arrival is about a brilliant linguist professor Louise Banks, who leads an elite team of investigators when these mysterious alien ships land in 12 different locations around the world in order to communicate with them. Amy Adams plays Louise Banks and right off the bat this is her best performance to date, I have been a fan of Adams for a while but she does a great job with the role. Forrest Whitaker is another great actor that does a good job in this film along with Adams, although Whitaker and Adams do great in this film I can't really say the same about Renner, however his performance wasn't terrible it just could have been better, but because I'm happy too see that he is not just doing Avenger films I will let it slide (not saying I hate the Avengers its just good to see him in another film). Denis Villeneuve is famous for directing films in the action or mystery genre such as Sicario (2015), and Prisoners (2013) so to see him craft a film in the sic fi genre is really refreshing, this is my probably favorite film from him. Arrival is not a perfect film, in fact I had my hopes high for it because I thought the premise was cool, and the cast and director were all great, but honestly I was kind of disappointed in it. Don't get me wrong the first half is extremely cool and interesting but as the film progresses you have to really pay attention well because this isn't a straight forward film and you will get lost. I also thought the film had a lot of flashbacks now don't get me wrong those are extremely important to the plot line of the film but they were kind of overly long too me. I also want to point out that do not watch Arrival expecting an action film, because this truly is a thinking persons movie. Though I expected Arrival to be a little better I still enjoyed it a lot, its a smart film with beautiful scenery, and some pretty great performances. If you are looking for an intelligent sci fi film that doesn't follow the usual cliches to the genre, with a cool tone, and smart dialogue than I highly recommend Arrival for you.",Jake M,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Aug 20, 2016",Jake M,/user/id/915806894,RT,915806894,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000176036422/picture

The movie is about aliens on the surface, but there's such a beautiful message it's trying to convey that makes it different. If you're looking for a fast-paced sci fi thriller, you will be dissappointed from this movie. However, if you appreciate the ability of movies to make you feel and think on a deeper level, you really need to check this one out.

4.0,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is fascinating from start to finish. The direction is beautiful and intriguing just as a good sci-fi movie should be. But don't walk into this film expecting a traditional science fiction movie. Arrival takes a familiar concept but it asks unfamiliar questions that make us think about how we would deal with this as a united people. Sure it has a plot twist, and it has fancy cgi, but what keeps you going through the film are the questions it asks about humans and our way of thinking. This is not Denis Villeneuve's best but it sure as hell makes for a great time for anyone who enjoys finding meaning in movies.

First, I respect directors who can make a movie entertaining to a larger audience and appealing to movie fans at the same time. Arrival is one of those very rare movies.

4.5,"""Now that's a proper introduction.""

  Arrival is truly something else. There hasn't been a sci-fi film like this in YEARS. It's philosophical, interesting, intelligent and extremely thought provoking. Amy Adams commands the screen as Dr. Louise Banks and she delivers one of her very best performances. She's a force to be reckoned with lately and she brings her A game with this one. I would love to go super in depth about this plot and all it's mechanisms, but I definitely don't want to spoil anything. This is a film that you need to go and see in the theater to fully experience it and form your thoughts on the story and it's deep meanings. I won't get into anything, but i'll just say you need to see the film. The execution is flawless, the writing is whip smart and progressive. The directing by Denis Villeneuve again cements him as one of the most original and brilliant directors we have working today. All the films i've seen of his have been incredible and have topped my best list at the end of the year and Arrival is destined to do the very same. I saw this film a few days ago and really haven't stopped thinking about it. It's themes are important, it's emotionally affecting, and it's a film that will make you think and one that will be analyzed for years to come. It's pace is slow but that's the type of movie it's supposed to be, slow and demanding. Stick with it and you will be rewarded with one of the most blazingly original and thoughtful sci-fi films i've seen in a long time. I can't say much about this one, so I'm going to wrap this one up without letting tinny go out, but I will say that you need to see it to believe it.",Spencer K,False,False,False,False,4.5,"Aug 15, 2016",Spencer K,/user/id/909713823,RT,909713823,

3.5,"Arrival is severely over-hyped but better than I expected. What does that say about Villeneuve and Bladerunner 2049? Hard to say but it seems like a warning sign. I came into the theater fresh off (relatively), Villeneuve's last film, Sicario, another grossly over-hyped early bird Oscar contender that flopped commercially, with the average viewer and eventually, with Oscar voters when it counted (and is now going on to become a gross trilogy like the finest pieces of faux-indie). Previously, I had been impressed by Villeneuve's Prisoners, although I wasn't awestruck. Safe to say that I haven't been riding the ridiculous hype-train this director took to get to the seat of the new Bladerunner sequel so my expectations coming in were tempered. Right off the bat, it became clear that Adams was a poor cast, remaining incapable of playing highly intelligent, logical, non-quirky characters (she's either intelligent and quirky or dopey and goofy, not much range beyond that). Her facial movements and tonal inflections continue to put her in a different role, even as she struggles (nobly I might add) to convey the dramatic heft of her character. It's an issue that gets better as the film goes on and it isn't anything against Adams (I've enjoyed her quirky work in American Hustle and Big Eyes and go no farther than Helena Bonham Carter to see just how well the typecast can work for a thespian) but it was on Villeneuve to cast correctly here and he chose (predictably) trendy as opposed to right. Thankfully, intentionally or not, the movie is extremely minimalist with Adams, especially in dialogue and as soon as we get past the necessary exposition, her character becomes much easier to watch. And this central portion of the film is where Villeneuve shines. The panoramic shots, the horn based soundtrack, the gripping emotional moments, all are there to great effect. Mind you, Forest Whitaker is a constant distraction, with an accent that fluctuates between deep South and embedded New Yorker quicker than you can say Kentucky Fried Bronx (it's clear that whatever you take from this film, his days of acting are mercifully drawing to a close, as his eye condition and poor inflection have hijacked all of his recent performances). Also distracting is the liberal lean of this film. In all my years of watching film, this is never a complaint I have had (even with Avatar proper, although it did play into my analysis after). I appreciate both a clear liberal lean in tone (as is the case with so many indie films) and the many liberal directors, who can still create well balanced works with many political facets for many viewers. The problem with Arrival is that Villeneuve isn't the least bit subtle and he's clearly been watching the 2016 election season way too much. As such, moments where the film might have subtly touched at some of the attitudes that impact it, we are instead jarred with an actual foray against fake news, a nearly there jab at Fox News and a bizarre redneck soldier bomb mutiny that is an improbable wink to posh leftists who prefer to stereotype the military from afar. Now to be clear, I don't disagree with Villeneuve on all of these points but the film is a subtle, artistic commentary on language and humanity. The ungainly hammer of these moments conflicts so strongly with the tone of the film that it puts the viewer off. It's going to be amusing to the average well-off, white faux-progressive but these moments aren't really good art or good taste. The idea that a scientist working on the first contact with non-human intelligent life would spend time surfing conservative alt-right fake news sites or that a rogue redneck soldier would be able to cobble together a Christian bomb brigade at the most important military site in the United States isn't just jarring, it's ludicrous. Villeneuve is a long way from the political artistry that directors such as Kubrick, Scorsese and Nolan managed with each film (try telling me Taxi Driver isn't a seamless liberal critique of the Vietnam War wrapped up perfectly in a coherent and artistic storyline). Great art has many facets, Villeneuve's art has few thus far. But getting through that, I appreciated this large chunk of the film. The core twist has been properly saved for the end, the flashbacks (or forward) are inserted coherently and when things come to a head, the appropriate emotional gravity is definitely there (a testament to Adams' effort here). And then unfortunately Villeneuve veers off the tracks. Just as I thought the movie would close into what honestly was, in my mind, a nearly great film, Villeneuve forgoes the ambiguity and beauty of a straight ending and goes full Peter Jackson. There's a barrage of flashbacks, a cobbled-together romance, a literal lets-make-a-baby line and just like that, the movie slips back into just good. It's the tipping point away from greatness that I also felt with Prisoners and Villeneuve's failure to make it here may just define his career at the end of the day. Instead the ending forces us to reflect on the logical and emotional inconsistencies of the film and trust me, that isn't a good thing in a time themed science-fiction film. And speaking of reflection, another reason why Villeneuve may want to avoid letting his audience do that is his propensity for copycatting recent work. Not only does Arrival bear striking similarities to Contact (antisocial, asexual female scientist with deep seated emotional needs stares pensively into the sky) but the cues from 2014's Interstellar are painfully obvious. The color palate, the soundtrack, the shot angle, the portrayal of alien landscapes and most importantly, the time based themes all feed directly from Nolan's previous (and original) masterpiece. Unfortunately Arrival lacks the heart, vision and humanity of that film, not to mention the tremendous mastery Nolan brings to all his work. It's a tacky feeling realization and although Arrival still stands out somewhat and has language as an important new theme, like any copycat, it loses some of its luster. Arrival is worth the watch but not worth the hype.",Phillip D,False,False,False,False,3.5,"Aug 11, 2016",Phillip D,/user/id/835284471,RT,835284471,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1384725776/picture
